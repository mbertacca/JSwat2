    <title>JSwat - Testing Views</title>
  </head>

  <body bgcolor="#ffffff">
    <h2>Testing Views</h2>

    <p>The &quot;views&quot; are presently only the source view window.
    This window displays the Java source code being debugged. It has
    the option of syntax highlighting the code to make it easier to
    read. Here are some test cases to ensure the view is working
    correctly.</p>

    <h3>Reading</h3>

    <p>The source view window reads and interprets the Java source file
    to provide two important features. First, it parses the Java code
    to determine: 1) the package name, 2) the line number range of the
    class definitions, and 3) the locations of the method definitions.
    This information is used by the source view popup menu in setting
    breakpoints and scrolling to methods. Second, the Java code is
    scanned lexically to identify elements to be colorized.</p>

    <p>Because of these two operations, the Java code must be
    well-formed. If there are any parser errors, the source view popup
    menu will not be able to set any breakpoints in that Java code. By
    the same token, if the lexical analyzer throws an exception, the
    view will not be colorized.</p>

    <h4>Tabs</h4>

    <p>Make sure the source view handles the tab characters correctly.
    In particular, they should be converted to the appropriate number
    of spaces. This works around a shortcoming in the text view in
    which tabs throw off the text component&#39;s width calculations.
    The tab width is determined in the user preferences under the
    &quot;View&quot; category. Try changing this value and ensure open
    views reflect the new value.</p>

    <h3>Tooltips</h3>

    <p>Whenever the debugging context is set (that is, the current
    thread, stack frame, and location are known) the source view will
    display the values of variables defined by the string under the
    mouse pointer. That is, if the mouse pointer hovers over the name
    of a variable in the Java code, a tooltip will appear, giving the
    value of that variable in the current stack frame.</p>

    <p>A couple of things to try.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Move the mouse over a non-variable. There should be no
      tooltip.</li>

      <li>Move the mouse past the end of the line. There should be no
      tooltip.</li>

      <li>Move the mouse to the start of the line. There should be no
      tooltip.</li>

      <li>Move the mouse to the gutter area. There should be no
      tooltip.</li>

      <li>Move the mouse over a variable whose values is null. Should
      should &quot;null&quot; as the value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Font</h3>

    <p>The source view uses the font and size defined in the user
    preferences. Make sure that changing this value actually changes
    the source view.</p>

    <h3>Colorizing</h3>

    <p>The source view will colorize the view contents according to a
    set of simple rules of the Java programming language. It can
    colorize anything, including non-Java code. Ensure that this
    colorization is happening, and that it can be turned off via the
    option in the user preferences.</p>

    <h3>Popup menu</h3>

    <p>A Java language parser is employed to enable the source view
    popup menu to know where classes are defined. With this
    information, the popup will show one of the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>&quot;Java parser error&quot; - if the Java parser had a
      problem.</li>

      <li>&quot;No class here&quot; - if there is no class at this
      line.</li>

      <li>One or more of: &quot;Add breakpoint&quot;, &quot;Run to this
      line&quot;, &quot;Disable breakpoint&quot;, &quot;Enable
      breakpoint&quot;, &quot;Breakpoint properties...&quot;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ensure that the appropriate popup menu messages are shown.</p>

    <p>In addition, the popup menu will contain a &quot;Methods&quot;
    submenu if the Java code was parsed successfully. This menu
    contains method descriptors of no more than 80 characters. When an
    item is selected, the view scrolls to the corresponding location in
    the source.</p>

    <h3>Single-stepping</h3>

    <p>While single-stepping through Java code, the source view window
    should be visible and the stepping line should be indicated by a
    blue highlight. Ensure that this is working by setting a breakpoint
    and stepping for a few lines.</p>

    <h3>Breakpoints</h3>

    <p>The source view indicates the position of breakpoints by
    coloring the area behind the line numbers. The line numbers are
    visible at the left of the source view area. The colors are as
    follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Red - expired</li>

      <li>Gray - disabled</li>

      <li>Blue - unresolved</li>

      <li>Yellow - skipping</li>

      <li>Green - ready</li>
    </ul>
