    <title>JSwat - Testing Console Mode</title>
  </head>

  <body bgcolor="#ffffff">
    <h2>Testing Console Mode</h2>

    <p>The console interface of JSwat is one of several possible modes
    in which the program can be run. This mode is useful when the test
    environment lacks a graphical component set based on JFC (Swing).
    In this case, JSwat must be launched with the
    &#39;<code>-console</code>&#39; switch. This switch must be the
    first one following the JSwat &quot;Main&quot; class name. See <a
    href="starting.html">this checklist</a> for a description of
    starting JSwat in console mode.</p>

    <p>The console mode lacks the panels, dialogs, toolbar, menubar,
    and source views, so testing these is impossible in this mode.
    Because all of these features are missing, it is especially
    important that JSwat alerts the user whenever the program status
    changes or events occur in the debuggee VM. So, testing the console
    interface consists primarily of testing the JSwat <a
    href="commands.html">commands</a>.</p>

    <h3>Command Input Prompt</h3>

    <p>The command input prompt (<code>&gt;</code>) is what prompts the
    user for input. Without this prompt the user will not soon realize
    that the program is waiting for input. Because of this, it is very
    important that the prompt always be printed after any command is
    invoked.</p>

    <p>With that said, it is necessary to realize that printing the
    prompt at exactly the right times is extremely difficult. It is
    made difficult by the fact that JSwat often prints out status
    messages and event alerts at random times. When this happens, it is
    impossible for the console adapter to know if there is more output
    to come or not. Instead, the console adapter does nothing in this
    case and relies on the close observance on the user&#39;s part to
    notice that the command input prompt is separated from the input
    cursor by events that where printed to the console. Fortunately,
    many Unix shell users are quite familiar with this problem. Most,
    if not all, xterm implementations have this very same problem.</p>
