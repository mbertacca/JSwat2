    <title>JSwat - Testing</title>
  </head>

    <h2>Testing JSwat</h2>

    <p>This document describes a series of tests that validate the
    proper operation of JSwat. When major releases of JSwat are made
    this checklist should be performed to ensure JSwat maintains a high
    level of quality. The tests described here are performed manually
    by developers. However, there is an extensive collection of
    automated unit tests, as well. See <a href="unit.html">this
    page</a> to learn more about those tests.</p>

    <h3>Actions</h3>

    <p>The Actions in JSwat are simply those features that are
    activated by either a menu item or a toolbar button. JSwat
    distinguishes them from the commands which have similar
    functionality but are invoked by typing commands into a text field.
    Use this <a href="actions.html">checklist</a> to test the
    actions.</p>

    <h3>Breakpoints</h3>

    <p>Breakpoints in JSwat are one of the most important features and
    require some of the most rigorous testing. Use this <a
    href="breakpoints.html">checklist</a> to test the breakpoints.</p>

    <h3>Commands</h3>

    <p>The Commands in JSwat are similar to the actions except that
    they are invoked by typing the commands at the command input
    prompt. This is most useful when running JSwat in console mode or
    when a similar action does not exist. The commands are tested
    primarily with <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>. See the
    test classes in the <code>test/junit</code> directory of the source
    distribution. Some commands cannot easily be tested automatically.
    Use this <a href="commands.html">checklist</a> to test those
    commands.</p>

    <h3>Console Mode</h3>

    <p>The console interface of JSwat is vastly different from the
    default, graphical interface, primarily because the panels and
    other status indicators are not available. This makes it especially
    important that the JSwat commands are verbose and that the program
    status is clearly indicated whenever it changes. Use this <a
    href="console.html">checklist</a> to test the console
    interface.</p>

    <h3>Panels</h3>

    <p>The panels in JSwat display information about the debuggee VM
    being debugged. Use this <a href="panels.html">checklist</a> to
    test the panels.</p>

    <h3>Paths</h3>

    <p>JSwat handles the classpath and sourcepath in a very particular
    way. Use this <a href="paths.html">checklist</a> to ensure that the
    paths are being handled correctly.</p>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>

    <p>The preferences in JSwat allow the user to configure how the
    program looks and behaves. Use this <a
    href="preferences.html">checklist</a> to test the preferences.</p>

    <h3>Shortcuts</h3>

    <p>Keyboard shortcuts are key combinations used to invoke certain
    actions in JSwat. These key combinations are often defined in the
    Preferences dialog of JSwat, in the &quot;Shortcuts&quot; category.
    Use this <a href="shortcuts.html">checklist</a> to test the
    keyboard shortcuts.</p>

    <h3>Starting</h3>

    <p>Starting JSwat is a category of its own due to the options
    available when launching the program. Use this <a
    href="starting.html">checklist</a> to test launching the
    program.</p>

    <h3>Views</h3>

    <p>The source view feature of JSwat is what makes single-stepping
    as productive as it is. Seeing the code while stepping through it
    is extremely valuable, and this feature needs as much attention to
    testing as any other. Use this <a href="view.html">checklist</a> to
    test the source view.</p>
