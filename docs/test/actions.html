    <ul>
      <li>Will always print at least one entry, usually for
      <code>com.sun.jdi.SocketAttach</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Attach to remote...</h3>

    <p>Shows dialog for inputting host name/port or a shared memory
    name of the debuggee VM to attach to.</p>

      <li>Attach button.</li>

      <li>Cancel button.</li>

      <li>Dialog close button.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Start VM...</h3>

    <p>Shows a dialog asking for class name and arguments, with
    optional debuggee VM options. In addition, the &quot;Java
    Home&quot; and &quot;JVM Executable&quot; fields are available and
    populated with default values.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ok with no class name. Should complain about missing
      name.</li>

      <li>Ok with invalid JVM executable. Should report that the VM
      load failed.</li>

      <li>Ok with invalid Java Home directory. Should report that the
      VM load failed.</li>

      <li>Ok with -classic or -hotspot in debuggee VM options. With JDK
      1.4 and later, the -classic option should generate a warning to
      the debuggee output.</li>

      <li>Some debuggee VM options are automatically generated by
      JSwat, such as the &quot;-classic&quot; and &quot;-cp&quot;
      arguments. These should not appear in the &quot;VM Options&quot;
      field, however.</li>

      <li>If &quot;Use -classic&quot; is selected in the options menu,
      the <code>-classic</code> option should be added automatically to
      the debuggee VM options.</li>

      <li>Ok with debuggee VM option containing an incorrect classpath,
      i.e. one that points to the wrong directory. When debuggee VM is
      resumed, should stop with <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>
      thrown and reported to the messages area.</li>

      <li>Ok with debuggee VM option containing <code>-cp &quot;class
      path</code> (note the missing closing quote). Should attempt to
      launch debuggee VM but will fail. The options printed to the Log
      should show &quot;[malformed classpath]&quot; at the point where
      the quote is missing.</li>

      <li>Ok with debuggee VM option containing <code>-cp &quot; class
      path&quot;</code> (note the initial space). This regresses bug
      365. Of course, having a space as the first character is
      generally not a valid path and will generate a class not found
      error.</li>

      <li>Ok with non-options in the debuggee VM options field. The
      non-options will be passed to the JVM executable which should
      stop and report an error (shown in the messages area).</li>

      <li>Any argument to <code>-cp</code> or <code>-classpath</code>
      will be saved as the classpath in the session properties.</li>

      <li>Ok button.</li>

      <li>Cancel button.</li>

      <li>Dialog close button.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>End session</h3>

    <p>Deactivates the current session.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If attached to a remote VM, the remote VM will remain
      running.</li>

      <li>If debuggee VM launched, will be terminated.</li>

      <li>Disabled when session is inactive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Terminate VM</h3>

    <p>Deactivates the current session, terminating debuggee VM.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If attached to a remote VM, the remote VM will be
      terminated.</li>

      <li>If debuggee VM launched, will be terminated.</li>

      <li>Disabled when session is inactive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Suspend</h3>

    <p>Suspends the debuggee VM.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If active, debuggee VM will be suspended.</li>

      <li>Suspend actions are not cumulative. Repeatedly suspending a
      debuggee VM will make no difference.</li>

      <li>Disabled when session is inactive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Resume</h3>

    <p>Resumes the suspended debuggee VM.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If active, debuggee VM will be resumed.</li>

      <li>Disabled when session is inactive.</li>
