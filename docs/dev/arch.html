  <title>JSwat Architecture</title>

  <h1>JSwat Architecture</h1>

  <p>JSwat is made up of several major sets of components: commands,
  panels, views, actions, breakpoints, managers, the session, the
  interface adapter, and the expression evaluator. Additionally there
  are a number of utility classes which support the primary
  components.</p>

  <p><img width="663" height="302" src="arch.png" alt="modules" /></p>

  <p>Pictured above we see all of the modules. The position of the
  blocks indicates dependence. For instance, the Session does not
  depend on any of the views, actions, panels, or commands, as those
  are above the Session in the module hierarchy. However, the Session
  makes use of the managers, breakpoints, and interface adapter. And by
  the same token, the other components rely on the Session (and
  possibly other components in the same layer). All of the components
  may depend on the Java Debug Interface and/or the Java core classes,
  as well as the utility classes in JSwat.</p>

  <p>You may have noticed that the borders between the commands,
  panels, views, and actions are straight lines. This is to indicate
  that these components do not rely on one another. For instance, the
  panels should never call on the views, or vice versa. This is to
  protect what little modularity exists in JSwat, so that it remains
  possible to remove one or the other components. For instance, there
  may be a release of JSwat that does not have the commands, or does
  not have the actions (or panels or views, for that matter). Thereby,
  it is necessary to firewall these components from one another to
  maintain this modularity.</p>
