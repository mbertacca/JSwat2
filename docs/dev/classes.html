    <h2>Important Classes</h2>

    <h3>Important JSwat Classes</h3>

    <p>The following are descriptions of the important classes in JSwat
    and what they are used for. Whenever you write new code for JSwat,
    or modify existing code, you will need to know what these classes
    do and how to make use of them.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>BreakpointManager</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>BreakpointManager</code> class is responsible for
      creating new breakpoints, deleting existing breakpoints, and
      notifying listeners whenever breakpoints have been disabled,
      enabled, added, or deleted. This is used by classes like
      <code>SourceView</code> to indicate graphically where breakpoints
      exist and their current state.</dd>

      <dt><strong>ContextManager</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>ContextManager</code> class is responsible for
      holding the context of the debugger and notifying listeners
      whenever the debugger context has changed. Context includes the
      current thread the user is examining, the current stack frame,
      and the current line the user is stepping through.</dd>

      <dt><strong>JSwatAction</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>JSwatAction</code> class is responsible for
      implementing the basic features of a JSwat action class. All
      JSwat actions must subclass from this abstract class.</dd>

      <dt><strong>JSwatCommand</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>JSwatCommand</code> class is responsible for
      implementing the basic features of a JSwat command class. All
      JSwat commands must subclass from this abstract class.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Panel</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>Panel</code> interface defines the methods that
      must be implemented by the display areas in JSwat. The base
      class, <code>BasicPanel</code> provides the basic functionality
      for all panels.</dd>

      <dt><strong>UIAdapter</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>UIAdapter</code> concrete implementations are
      responsible for constructing the user interface. In the graphical
      mode, this includes the menubar, toolbar and display panels.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Session</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>Session</code> class is responsible for holding
      everything together. This class is the facade to numerous other
      classes in the debugger. It is used to create a new debugging
      session, deactivate a session, and access the various important
      objects in the debugger.</dd>

      <dt><strong>PathManager</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>PathManager</code> class is responsible for mapping
      code locations to source files. It provides convenient methods
      for accessing the classpath and sourcepath settings in
      JSwat.</dd>

      <dt><strong>VMEventManager</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>VMEventManager</code> class is responsible for
      receiving events from the debuggee VM and delegating them to the
      appropriate listeners. This class efficiently holds the lists of
      listeners based on the VM events they are registered for, and
      keeps them in sorted order by priority. This allows classes like
      <code>Session</code> to receive the events before other objects
      in JSwat.</dd>

      <dt><strong>View</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>View</code> interface defines the methods that must
      be implemented by the source view area in JSwat. The base class,
      <code>BasicView</code> provides the basic functionality for all
      views that display textual information, such as source code.</dd>
