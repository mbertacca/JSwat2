  <h3>Variables</h3>

  <h4>Locals Panel</h4>

  <p>The values of variables are displayed in the local variables
  panel. The values in that panel are updated as you single-step
  through your program. The panel is displayed using a tree, so objects
  show their field variable values as child nodes. You can expand the
  nodes to examine the complex fields.</p>

  <p>Objects are shown using the tilted box icon. The type of the
  object is shown in parentheses. The number following the type
  indicates the unique identifier used to identify this object in the
  debuggee VM. This is not the hash code of the object, and the value
  will change from one instance of the VM to another.</p>

  <p>Nodes in the tree that are shown with a circular arrow indicate
  that the variable is an object reference that refers back to an
  object already shown higher up the variable tree hierarchy. It
  indicates a loop in the object references, which would generally be
  confusing if not clearly indicated.</p>

  <p>Arrays are indicated with an icon that looks like a bulleted list
  of three lines. The type of the array is shown in parentheses and the
  size of the array is shown in brackets. Entries in the array are
  shown as child nodes of the array. The number in brackets is the
  array index and the type is shown in parentheses. The value for the
  entry is shown following the colon. Double-clicking on the
  &quot;...&quot; array entry will expand the entire array, showing all
  of the array elements. This is not advisable for large arrays.</p>

  <p>By default the field variables of the &#39;<code>this</code>&#39;
  object are placed within a tree node with the name &quot;this&quot;.
  If instead you would prefer the field variables be displayed under
  the root tree node, use the locals panel popup menu to toggle the
  option. A drawback of showing the field variables at the top level is
  that local variables of the same name will hide the field
  variables.</p>

  <h5>Viewing source for type</h5>

  <p>The locals panel popup menu has an item for viewing the source
  code for the type of the variable under the mouse pointer. This works
  perfectly well for variables with a non-null value. For null
  variables, the type will be the declared type and not the actual
  type. This may not be what you would expect. Additionally, there is
  no source code for the primitives types, so a warning will be
  displayed in the status bar indicating that the source for the type
  could not be located.</p>

  <h4>Watch Panel</h4>

  <p>Another way of watching the values of field variables as they
  change is with the watch panel. This panel allows you to watch any
  field variable of any object as well as local variables. To watch a
  variable, first suspend the debuggee VM using a breakpoint. Set the
  breakpoint in a method that is within the scope of the variable to be
  watched. When the debuggee VM stops, type the name of the variable
  into the watch panel&#39;s empty &quot;name&quot; cell, then press
  Enter. The watch panel will then display the changing value of the
  variable as you single step through code.</p>

  <p>The <code>this</code> keyword can be used to distinguish field
  variables from like-named local variables. Objects are shown as the
  string returned from their <code>toString()</code> method, if
  possible. Otherwise they are shown as the string representation of
  the JDI object.</p>

  <p>To stop watching a variable, simply erase the name and press
  Enter. The table row will be removed and the watch point will be
  deleted. A popup menu for the panel allows you to remove all of the
  watchpoints at once.</p>

  <p>If the debuggee VM does not support instance filters, any watched
  field will be for all object instances. This is not terribly useful
  in which case you should avoid using the watch panel. See the
  <code>support</code> command to determine which features the debuggee
  supports.</p>

  <h4>Other Views of Variables</h4>

  <p>Local variables can be displayed with the <code>locals</code>
  command, which will display all the visible variables and their
  values. However, this will not show field values of objects. Instead,
  use the <code>dump</code> command described below.</p>

  <p>To view the value of a single variable, use the <code>print</code>
  command. This takes the name of a variable and prints its value to
  the message window. The <code>print</code> command can even take the
  name of an object with a reference to a field variable. For example,
  if a local variable called &quot;date&quot; is a Date object and you
  want to print the &quot;hourField&quot; field variable of that
  object, you would type &#39;<code>print date.hourField</code>&#39; at
  the command prompt.</p>

  <p>The <code>dump</code> command operates much like
  <code>print</code> except that it shows all the field variables and
  their values for the named object.</p>

  <h4>Setting Variables</h4>

  <p>Variable values can be modified using the <code>set</code>
  command. See the command help for the syntax. The type of the value
  on the right of the equals sign is ascertained by the type of the
  variable referenced on the left side of the equals sign. That is, if
  the variable being set is an Integer or int type, then the value is
  interpreted as an integer.</p>

  <p>Note that it is currently possible to set values that are meant to
  be constants.</p>
