    <h3>The Toolbar</h3>

    <p>The toolbar is a set of buttons, usually located just below the
    menu bar of the main window. These buttons provide triggers for
    commonly accessed functions. Most buttons in the toolbar are also
    represented by a menu item in one of the menus.</p>

    <p>The toolbar can be moved from the top of the window to the
    bottom, or either side of the window. Where the toolbar is
    positioned is remembered between invocations of the program. The
    toolbar can also be dragged out of the main window and left
    floating. This position is not remembered and the toolbar will
    reappear in the main window the next time the program is
    started.</p>
