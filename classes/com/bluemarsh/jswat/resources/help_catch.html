    <h3>Catching Exceptions</h3>

    <p>JSwat supports catching exceptions as if they were breakpoints.
    This includes exceptions that are caught in the Java code running
    in the debuggee VM and exceptions that are not caught.</p>

    <p>The <code>catch</code> command can be used to create an
    exception catch. There is also a like-named item in the
    &quot;Breakpoints&quot; menu. Catching an exception requires the
    name of the exception to be caught. This must either be a
    fully-qualified class name or a wild-carded class name (i.e. has a
    &#39;*&#39; either at the beginning or end of the name).</p>

    <p>Exception breakpoints can have both class and thread filters.
    See the <a href="help_breakpoints.html">breakpoints help</a> for
    the section on setting up filters. The class filters apply to the
    class that is throwing the exception.</p>

    <p>A single exception may be thrown multiple times. JSwat does not
    distinguish this case and so it may appear that more than one
    exception is being caught when in fact it is one exception that has
    been re-thrown.</p>

    <p>JSwat always creates an invisible exception breakpoint for all
    uncaught exceptions. This breakpoint cannot be removed or modified
    as it is not visible to the user.</p>
