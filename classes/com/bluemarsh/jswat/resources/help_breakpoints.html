  <h3>Breakpoints</h3>

  <h4>How to Set Breakpoints</h4>

  <p>JSwat supports setting several types of breakpoints. Typically
  breakpoints will be set at a particular location in code. These
  breakpoints can be set in one of several ways. First there is the
  <code>stop</code> command which can be used to set a breakpoint at a
  particular method or at a code line in a class. Second, there is the
  &quot;Set Breakpoint&quot; item in the &quot;Breakpoints&quot; menu.
  Additionally, the source view can be used to set breakpoints through
  its popup menu.</p>

  <p>For help on using the <code>stop</code> command, type
  &#39;<code>help stop</code>&#39; at the command prompt to learn the
  syntax for the command. To set a breakpoint inside an inner class,
  use a dollar sign (<code>$</code>) to separate the names of the outer
  and inner classes. Here are examples of valid breakpoint
  specifications:</p>
  <pre>
  MyClass:213
  mypackage.MyClass.myMethod(String, int)
  *.ClassName$Inner:41
</pre>

  <p>The first example is setting a breakpoint at line 213 in the class
  MyClass. The second example demonstrates setting a breakpoint at a
  method, by giving the method name and argument types. You do not give
  the argument names, just the argument types, consisting of primitives
  (&quot;boolean&quot;, &quot;byte&quot;, &quot;char&quot;,
  &quot;double&quot;, &quot;float&quot;, &quot;int&quot;,
  &quot;long&quot;, &quot;short&quot;) and class names. Classes in the
  &quot;java.lang&quot; package are matched automatically if not
  fully-qualified (e.g. &quot;String&quot;). The third example uses a
  wildcard to match one or more classes; it also specifies an inner
  class.</p>

  <h4>What Breakpoints Do I Have Set?</h4>

  <p>Any breakpoints that have been set are assigned numbers. The
  numbers assigned to a breakpoint remain in effect for the life of the
  breakpoint. To see the breakpoints and their numbers, use the
  <code>brkinfo</code> command with no arguments.</p>

  <p>To see the breakpoints in a panel, select the
  &quot;Breakpoints...&quot; tab, found just above the Messages text
  area. This panel displays the breakpoints in their breakpoint groups.
  Breakpoints drawn in bold are resolved, while disabled breakpoints
  are italicised. If the breakpoint label is in plain text (neither
  bold nor italic), then it is unresolved and enabled.</p>

  <p>Breakpoints are also visually displayed in the source view. The
  breakpoints are indicated by colorizing the source view gutter. See
  the <a href="help_view.html#gutter">view help</a> for the
  details.</p>

  <h4>How to Disable/Enable Breakpoints</h4>

  <p>There are no less than four ways to disable and enable
  breakpoints. The first is through the <code>disable</code> and
  <code>enable</code> commands. These each take the number of the
  breakpoint (as described above) to disable or enable.</p>

  <p>The second way to disable and enable breakpoints is by using the
  breakpoints panel. Select the breakpoint you want to change and click
  one of the buttons on the right side of the panel.</p>

  <p>The third way to disable and enable breakpoints is by using the
  source view. If a source file is displayed which shows breakpoints,
  you can right click on the line with the breakpoint and a popup menu
  will appear. This menu has items to disable, enable, and remove
  breakpoints.</p>

  <p>Yet another means of altering breakpoints is by clicking in the
  source view gutter. See the <a href="help_view.html#gutter">view
  help</a> for the details.</p>

  <h4>How to Clear Breakpoints</h4>

  <p>There are no less than four ways to clear breakpoints. The first
  is through the <code>clear</code> command. This takes the number of
  the breakpoint (as described above) to remove.</p>

  <p>The second way to disable and enable breakpoints is by using the
  breakpoints panel. Select the breakpoint you want to change and click
  one of the buttons on the right side of the panel.</p>

  <p>The third way to clear breakpoints is by using the source view. If
  a source file is displayed which shows breakpoints, you can right
  click on the line with the breakpoint and a popup menu will appear.
  This menu has items to disable, enable, and remove breakpoints.</p>

  <p>Yet another means of clearing breakpoints is by clicking in the
  source view gutter. See the <a href="help_view.html#gutter">view
  help</a> for the details.</p>

  <h4>Grouping Breakpoints</h4>

  <p>Breakpoints are automatically added to a breakpoint group called
  &quot;Default&quot;. Via the breakpoints panel it is possible to
  create new breakpoint groups and move breakpoints to that group.
  Breakpoint groups can be disabled, causing all of the breakpoints
  contained within them to also be disabled. Re-enabling the group will
  restore the breakpoints to their original enabled state.</p>

  <p>Breakpoint groups can contain other groups, which may contain yet
  other groups.</p>

  <p>Deleting a breakpoint group will delete all of the breakpoints and
  groups contained therein.</p>

  <p>The &quot;Default&quot; breakpoint group cannot be deleted and it
  will be automatically re-enabled whenever a session is restarted.</p>

  <h4>Skipping and Expiration</h4>

  <p>All breakpoints support the notion of skipping and expiration.
  Skipping means that a breakpoint will be hit but will immediately
  resume execution of the debuggee VM until the breakpoint has been hit
  enough times. A skip value of zero means the breakpoint will not skip
  at all. This is the default.</p>

  <p>Expiration is the inverse of skipping, where the breakpoint will
  halt execution of the VM until the breakpoint expires. An expiration
  value of zero means the breakpoint will never expire. This is the
  default.</p>

  <p>If the skip value is larger than the expiration value (assuming
  the expiration value is non-zero), the breakpoint will effectively
  never halt execution of the debuggee VM.</p>

  <h4>Manipulating Multiple Breakpoints</h4>

  <p>Using the breakpoints panel, select all the breakpoints you want
  to modify, then select the button to modify them. You can enable,
  disable, and remove multiple breakpoints in this manner.</p>

  <h4>Breakpoint Conditions</h4>

  <p>Breakpoints may have one or more conditions assigned to them,
  allowing you to avoid hitting the breakpoint more often than is
  necessary. Presently only one type of breakpoint condition is
  supported, called an &quot;expression&quot; condition. The condition
  is satisfied when the given boolean expression evaluates to true. The
  ==, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &amp;&amp;, and || boolean
  operators are supported. See the <a href="help_eval.html">Expression
  Evaluation</a> for more information about expressions.</p>

  <h4>Breakpoint Monitors</h4>

  <p>Breakpoints may have one or more monitors assigned to them. A
  monitor is an action that is &quot;performed&quot; whenever the
  breakpoint is hit. The breakpoint must be enabled, not skipping, and
  not expired. Presently only one type of monitor is supported, called
  a &quot;command&quot; monitor. When this monitor is performed, the
  named command is executed, just as if you had entered it at the
  command prompt.</p>

  <h4>Thread Suspend Policy</h4>

  <p>Normally when a breakpoint causes execution of the debuggee VM to
  stop, all of the debuggee threads are suspended. This behavior can be
  modified with the breakpoints properties dialog. The &quot;Suspend
  Threads&quot; radio buttons indicate which threads should be
  suspended when the breakpoint is hit. The &quot;None&quot; and
  &quot;All&quot; options are obvious. The &quot;Event&quot; option
  causes only the thread in which the breakpoint event occurred to
  suspend.</p>

  <h4>Filters</h4>

  <p>Location-based breakpoints (line and method) support thread
  filters. That is, the breakpoint is only considered hit if it occurs
  on a particular thread or threads. The set of threads can be
  manipulated using either the breakpoint properties dialog box, or
  through the <code>filter</code> command.</p>

  <p>Thread filters can only be applied when the thread exists at the
  time the breakpoint is resolved. If a single filter is provided and
  the chosen thread does not exist, the breakpoint will still cause the
  debuggee to halt when the breakpoint location is reached.</p>

  <p>Traces and exception catches can have both thread and class
  filters. A class filter causes the trace or catch to only operate
  when the event occurs within the given class or classes. The set of
  class can be manipulated using either the breakpoint properties
  dialog box, or through the <code>filter</code> command.</p>

  <h3>Other Types of Breakpoints</h3>

  <h4>Class</h4>

  <p>A class breakpoint is one that halts execution when a particular
  class has either prepared or unloaded. This type of breakpoint can be
  created with either the <code>classbrk</code> command or the dialog
  accessible from the &quot;Class Breakpoint...&quot; menu item in the
  &quot;Breakpoints&quot; menu. Like trace breakpoints, class
  breakpoints use class filters to filter on one or more classes. As
  with all other types of breakpoints, class breakpoints have
  properties that can be managed via the properties editor dialog.</p>

  <h4>Thread</h4>

  <p>A thread breakpoint is one that halts execution when a particular
  thread has either started or died. This type of breakpoint can be
  created with either the <code>threadbrk</code> command or the dialog
  accessible from the &quot;Thread Breakpoint...&quot; menu item in the
  &quot;Breakpoints&quot; menu. Thread breakpoints can be set for one
  or all threads. That is, either it stops for a single thread of a
  given name, or it stops for all threads. As with all other types of
  breakpoints, thread breakpoints have properties that can be managed
  via the properties editor dialog.</p>

  <h4>Watch</h4>

  <p>A watch breakpoint is one that halts execution when a particular
  field variable has either been accessed or modified. This type of
  breakpoint can be created with either the <code>watch</code> command
  or the dialog accessible from the &quot;Watch Variable...&quot; menu
  item in the &quot;Breakpoints&quot; menu.</p>

  <p>Because watch breakpoints refer to a particular field in a
  particular class, it is necessary to set the watchpoint when that
  field is visible. That is, in order for the watchpoint to work, the
  debugger&#39;s current location must be set at a point in your code
  where the desired field is visible. Otherwise, an error message is
  printed to the messages panel, and the watchpoint will be disabled.
  It can be enabled when the current location is properly set. A
  watchpoint is automatically disabled when the debuggee VM exits or is
  disconnected.</p>

  <p>Watchpoints support object instance filters, in which events will
  occur only for a specific object instance. This is useful when you
  want to watch for a field change in just one of many objects of the
  same class. However, because of the ephemeral nature of objects, this
  filter only lasts as long as the active session. When the session
  deactivates, the instance filter is automatically erased. A new
  watchpoint will have to be created from that point forward.</p>

  <p>If the debuggee VM does not support instance filters, any watched
  field will be for all object instances. This is not terribly useful
  in which case you should avoid using watchpoints. See the
  <code>support</code> command to determine which features the debuggee
  supports.</p>

  <p>As with all other types of breakpoints, watchpoints have
  properties that can be managed via the properties editor dialog.</p>
