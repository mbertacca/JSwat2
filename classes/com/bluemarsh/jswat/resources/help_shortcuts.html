    <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

    <h4>Using the Shortcuts</h4>

    <p>Keyboard shortcuts are simply keyboard equivalents for invoking
    certain menu items. For instance, the single step menu item can be
    invoked using the mouse by clicking on the &quot;Step&quot; menu
    and selecting the &quot;Step Line&quot; item. In addition to using
    the mouse, there should be a keyboard key that is also assigned to
    invoke that menu item. By default it is the F11 key. On most user
    interfaces, the shortcut keys are indicated in the menu itself.
    Next to the words &quot;Step Line&quot; you should see
    &quot;F11&quot;.</p>

    <h4>Reassigning the Shortcuts</h4>

    <p>To change the keys used to invoke menu items, use the
    preferences dialog. This is accessed from the
    &quot;Preferences&quot; menu item in the &quot;Options&quot; menu.
    Select the &quot;Shortcuts&quot; tab in the dialog to see the
    assignable keyboard shortcuts. There are presently only a small set
    of menu items with keyboard shortcuts, but over time this will
    improve.</p>

    <p>The allowable values for keyboard shortcuts are defined by the
    <code>getKeyStroke(String)</code> method in class
    <code>javax.swing.KeyStroke()</code>. That information is reprinted
    here for your convenience.</p>

    <p>The keystroke string has the following syntax:</p>
<pre>
     &lt;modifiers&gt;* (&lt;typedID&gt; | &lt;pressedReleasedID&gt;)
     modifiers := shift | control | meta | alt | button1 | button2 | button3
     typedID := typed &lt;typedKey&gt;
     typedKey := string of length 1 giving Unicode character.
     pressedReleasedID := (pressed | released)? key
     key := KeyEvent keycode name, i.e. the name following &quot;VK_&quot;.
</pre>

    <p>If typed, pressed or released is not specified, pressed is
    assumed. The button1, button2, and button3 modifiers refer to the
    respective mouse buttons. Here are some examples:</p>
<pre>
     &quot;INSERT&quot;
     &quot;control DELETE&quot;
     &quot;alt shift X&quot;
     &quot;alt shift released X&quot;
     &quot;typed a&quot;
</pre>

    <h4>Reserved Key Combinations</h4>

    <p>The Java Foundation Classes, the component set used by JSwat to
    build the graphical interface, seems to reserve some key
    combinations. In particular:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>F6 &amp; F8 - accessibility hot keys.</li>

      <li>F10 - opens the first menu in the menu bar.</li>
    </ul>
