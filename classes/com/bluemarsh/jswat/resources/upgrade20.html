<h2>Upgrading to JSwat 2.x</h2>

<p>It appears that you are running JSwat 2.x for the first time, after
having run an earlier version of the program. This message provides
information pertaining to your personalized settings.</p>

<p>JSwat 2.x now stores all of your personalized settings inside nodes
of type <code>java.util.prefs.Preferences</code>. The old settings are
completely ignored. You may want to remove the old files. They are
stored in a directory called <code>.jswat</code> in your home directory.
The files that are no longer used are: <code>breakpoints</code>,
<code>preferences</code>, <code>session</code>, and
<code>settings</code>.</p>

<p>This change was brought about for a number of reasons, one of which
was to reduce the overall code size of JSwat. The other was to simplify
the manner in which the settings were managed. However, this means you
will now have to reset all of your preferences. I apologize for the
inconvenience.</p>
