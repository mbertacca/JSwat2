    <h3>Sessions</h3>

    <h4>What is a Session?</h4>

    <p>A JSwat Session is the object that manages the debuggee VM. It
    launches a debuggee or connects to a remote debuggee. A Session can
    suspend and resume the debuggee. The Session also keeps a variety
    of persistent settings called properties.</p>

    <h4>Session Properties</h4>

    <p>The properties of a Session include the classpath, sourcepath,
    list of single-step exclusions, last-used search phrase,
    watchpoints, main debuggee class, remote host and port, JVM options
    and so on. All of these properties are initially empty until they
    are defined during normal interaction with JSwat. The properties
    are automatically saved to persistent storage for subsequent
    reuse.</p>

    <p>JSwat has support for multiple sets of Session properties. Only
    one set can be loaded at any given time. The &quot;File&quot; menu
    has items for opening, copying, and deleting sessions. By default
    there is a session with the name &quot;default&quot;. You can
    delete this and it will be remade with empty properties.</p>

    <h4>Active versus Inactive</h4>

    <p>At startup the session is inactive. This is discernible by the
    fact that numerous menu items and toolbar buttons are disabled
    during an inactive session (such as the single-step buttons). To
    activate the session, click the &quot;New&quot; icon on the toolbar
    or select &quot;Start VM&quot; from the &quot;VM&quot; menu. Once
    the session has activated, the full set of menu items and toolbar
    buttons becomes enabled and ready for use.</p>
