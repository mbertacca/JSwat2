    <h3>Debuggee I/O</h3>

    <p>The output from the debuggee is typically displayed in the
    &quot;Output&quot; panel. If JSwat connected to a remote debuggee
    then the output of the debuggee is displayed in the console that
    started the debuggee.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Output&quot; panel is limited to a maximum number of
    lines. This value is set in the preferences dialog, accessible from
    the &quot;Options&quot; menu.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Input&quot; field below the &quot;Output&quot; panel
    is for sending keyboard input to the debuggee on the
    <code>System.in</code> input stream. This is only useful for
    console-based applications and would probably not be used if the
    debuggee utilizes a graphical interface.</p>
