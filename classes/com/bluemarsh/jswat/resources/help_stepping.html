    <h3>Stepping Through Code</h3>

    <p>Stepping in source code executes just one instruction or line of
    code in the debuggee at a time. This is useful for finding exactly
    where a particular condition occurs in the code. The actions
    described below are accessible via the named commands as well as
    through the &quot;Step&quot; menu items.</p>

    <h4>Operations</h4>

    <p>There are several commands for stepping through source code.
    They are described as follows.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>step</code></dt>

      <dd>Step a single line of source code, going <em>into</em> method
      calls, if any. That is, if there is a method call being made,
      execution will be halted at the top of that new method.</dd>

      <dt><code>next</code></dt>

      <dd>Step a single line of source code, going <em>through</em>
      method calls, if any. That is, it runs the method at full speed
      rather than stepping into it.</dd>

      <dt><code>stepi</code></dt>

      <dd>Step a single instruction, going <em>into</em> method calls,
      if any.</dd>

      <dt><code>nexti</code></dt>

      <dd>Step a single instruction, going <em>through</em> method
      calls, if any.</dd>

      <dt><code>step out|up</code></dt>

      <dd>Returns to the line that invoked the current method. This is
      identical to the &quot;finish&quot; operation found in other
      debuggers.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Exclusion filters</h4>

    <p>At some point or another you will single-step into the Java core
    classes. This will happen often enough that you wish you could
    avoid stepping into such classes. Fortunately, JSwat provides the
    <code>exclude</code> command for just this purpose. You can add
    individual classes and entire packages to the list of class
    filters. During single-stepping, the debugger will not step into
    these classes. See the exclude command help for more
    information.</p>
