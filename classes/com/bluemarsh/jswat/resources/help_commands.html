    <h3>Commands</h3>

    <p>Much of the functionality of JSwat lies in two places: the
    graphical user interface and the command interface. The command
    interface is accessible both in JSwat&#39;s &quot;console&quot;
    mode and in its default graphical mode. In graphical mode, the
    command interface is made up of the &quot;Messages&quot; text area
    and the &quot;Command&quot; text field. Commands are entered in the
    text field and the results are displayed in the messages area.</p>

    <p>To get familiar with the many JSwat commands, I recommend
    running the <code>help</code> command after starting JSwat. This
    will present you with various categories of commands and let you
    browse through the categories. You can learn what commands are used
    for manipulating breakpoints, single-stepping, and many other
    debugging-related operations.</p>

    <h4>Arguments</h4>

    <p>Many commands take one or more arguments. The command arguments
    follow the name of the command, separated by spaces. Multiple
    spaces are irrelevant. Arguments may be enclosed in single or
    double quotes (<code>&#39;</code> or <code>&quot;</code>). Quoting
    the arguments is useful when passing arguments that contain spaces.
    Some commands have exceptions to their acceptance of quoted
    arguments, and they are clearly indicated in the command help.</p>

    <h4>History</h4>

    <p>Commands are stored in a &quot;history chain&quot; and can be
    invoked using the <code>!&lt;prefix&gt;</code> and <code>!!</code>
    operators. Earlier commands can be recalled using the up and down
    cursor keys (or Ctrl-p and Ctrl-n keys) to move backward and
    forward through the command history. (Note, this feature is not
    available in console mode.)</p>

    <h4>Aliases</h4>

    <p>Commands can be aliased to other names, offering you the ability
    to make the interface more convenient. Both a command and its
    arguments can be stored as an alias. The alias is invoked by the
    alias name, and may include additional arguments to the original
    command. Use the <code>alias</code> and <code>unalias</code>
    commands to manage aliases.</p>

    <p>Aliases can be used as a form of &quot;macro&quot;. That is, an
    alias can be made up of multiple commands, separated by semicolons.
    Invoking multiple commands is described below.</p>

    <h4>Invoking Multiple Commands</h4>

    <p>The JSwat command interpreter understands using the semicolon
    (<code>;</code>) character to separate multiple commands on a
    single command line. For instance, the following input string would
    be interpreted as two separate commands, executed in series.</p>
<pre>
classpath &quot;c:\classes&quot; ; sourcepath &quot;c:\source&quot;
</pre>

    <p>Because of this special separator character, you must be careful
    to quote any command arguments that contain the separator. For
    instance, the following would be misinterpreted as two
    commands.</p>
<pre>
classpath c:\classes;d:\stuff.jar
</pre>

    <p>The proper way to run that command would be to enclose the
    classpath argument in quotes, like so:</p>
<pre>
classpath &quot;c:\classes;d:\stuff.jar&quot;
</pre>

    <p>Note that the backslash (<code>\</code>) character causes the
    subsequent character to be treated as a normal character. That is,
    if the sequence &quot;<code>\;</code>&quot; is parsed, the
    semicolon will have no special significance. This can be useful if
    you need to escape a quote character or perhaps a backslash.</p>

    <h4>Startup File</h4>

    <p>JSwat processes what is often called a startup file. That is,
    when JSwat is started, it looks for a file with a particular name
    and processes it. This file may contain JSwat commands to be
    executed when JSwat starts. The file is called
    <code>.jswat/init</code> and lives in your home directory. JSwat
    also looks for a file named <code>jswat.init</code> in the current
    directory, and each parent directory until it reaches of the root
    of the file system, processing the files in the order they are
    found.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of a startup file.</p>

    <blockquote>
<pre>
#
# Lines starting with the # character are ignored.
#

# Create some useful command aliases.
alias   go              resume
alias   cont            resume
alias   quit            exit
alias   finish          step out

# Set the path where jswat looks for source files.
sourcepath /usr/java/src
</pre>
    </blockquote>
