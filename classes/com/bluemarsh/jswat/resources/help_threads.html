    <title>Threads, Call Stack</title>

    <h3>Threads, Call Stack</h3>

    <p>The debuggee threads are displayed in the &quot;Threads&quot;
    panel. The <code>threads</code> command will also display the
    threads of the debuggee.</p>

    <h4>Current Thread</h4>

    <p>JSwat has a notion of a &quot;current&quot; thread. That is, the
    thread upon which various operations are performed. The current
    thread is set automatically when the debuggee hits a breakpoint of
    any kind. Otherwise, the current thread can be set manually using
    the <code>thread</code> command. It can also be set by clicking on
    the thread in the &quot;Threads&quot; panel.</p>

    <p>The current thread is indicated in the &quot;Threads&quot; panel
    by drawing it with an italic font. The <code>threads</code> command
    uses the asterisk (*) character to indicate the current thread.</p>

    <p>Any operations which require the current thread to be set will
    report an error message if the current thread has not been set.</p>

    <p>The &quot;Threads&quot; panel has a popup menu which provides
    access to related functions and options. These menu items should be
    self-explanatory.</p>

    <h4>Call Stack</h4>

    <p>When the debuggee is suspended and the current thread is set,
    the call stack is displayed in the &quot;Stack&quot; panel. The
    stack can also be displayed using the <code>where</code>
    command.</p>

    <p>Whenever a breakpoint is hit, the current stack frame is set to
    zero. The current frame is indicated by drawing it with an italic
    font, and the frame can be changed by double-clicking on the
    corresponding entry in the &quot;Stack&quot; panel. This has the
    side-effect of opening the source file for the location given by
    that frame. The current stack frame can also be changed using the
    <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, or <code>frame</code>
    commands.</p>
