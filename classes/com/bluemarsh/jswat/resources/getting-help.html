    <h3>Getting Help</h3>

    <p>So you have downloaded JSwat and hoped it would solve your
    debugging needs, but alas, something is not working as you
    expected. Well, do not fret. Read this useful list of tips on how
    to get help, as well as how to help yourself.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>First, did you read the help information? If you not, you may
      very well have missed something.</li>

      <li>Use the <code>help</code> command. All of the JSwat commands
      have a built-in help function. If you have a question about a
      JSwat command, this is a good start.</li>

      <li>Did you check the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)? If not,
      go on-line and <a href= 
      "http://www.bluemarsh.com/java/jswat/docs/faq.html">check them
      out</a>.</li>

      <li>
        Ask for help. There are two avenues for asking questions about
        JSwat. The first is to email the author: nfiedler@bluemarsh.com
        The second is to send the question to the jswat-user mailing
        list. If you choose either of these options, you will get a
        quicker resolution to your problem if you provide the following
        information along with your question: 

        <ul>
          <li>Operating System (e.g. Windows, Linux, Solaris)</li>

          <li>JDK version (e.g. 1.2.2, 1.3.1, or 1.4.0)</li>

          <li>JDK brand (e.g. Sun, IBM, Blackdown)</li>

          <li>JSwat version (better to be the latest)</li>

          <li>Your classpath and sourcepath settings.</li>

          <li>Description of what you are trying to do.</li>

          <li>Any pertinent error messages.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
