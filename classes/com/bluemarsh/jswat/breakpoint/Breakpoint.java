/**
 * Interface Breakpoint defines the methods applicable to a breakpoint.
 * Breakpoints have several states, including enabled, disabled,
 * expired, and resolved. Breakpoints have several optional elements.
 * First they have a "skip" count, which tells the breakpoint not to
 * stop until it has been hit a certain number of times. Then
 * breakpoints may expire after a number of hits, in which case they
 * will no longer stop.
 *
 * <p>All concrete breakpoint implementations should set a "breakpoint"
 * property in their <code>com.sun.jdi.request.EventRequest</code>
 * object. This is used by the breakpoint manager to retrieve the
 * breakpoint object from the event request object.</p>
