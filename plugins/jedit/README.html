  <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

  <p>JSwat is a Java debugger developed primarily by Nathan Fiedler and
  can be found at the <a href=
  "http://www.bluemarsh.com/java/jswat/">JSwat website</a>. The jEdit
  plugin was initially developed by David Taylor, then later maintained
  by Stefano Maestri. In February of 2003 the plugin was merged into
  the JSwat project and Nathan Fiedler is now the maintainer of the
  plugin.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The JSwat plugin integrates JSwat with jEdit, making it possible
  to debug Java code directly within jEdit. While not all of the JSwat
  functionality is provided through the graphical interface, the most
  important features are available in the menu and dockable window.</p>

  <p>The plugin provides menu items and toolbar buttons for controlling
  the debuggee (attach, detach, start, stop, suspend, resume) and
  setting breakpoints. It also displays the usual JSwat panels for
  displaying threads, local and field variables, the loaded classes,
  the call stack, and so on. In addition, the usual JSwat command
  interface is available to utilize all of JSwat&#39;s debugging
  commands.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <p>The requirements for the JSwat plugin include the same
  requirements as JSwat itself. That is, the JPDA classes must be made
  available to the plugin in order for it to start. If the JPDA classes
  are contained in the <code>tools.jar</code> file in the JDK
  <code>lib</code> directory, they will be loaded automatically. If
  not, then continue reading this section.</p>

  <p>See the JSwat <a href=
  "http://www.bluemarsh.com/repos/jswat/trunk/README.html">README</a>
  for how to make the JPDA classes available to the plugin. In addition
  to the possibilities listed in that file, you can also copy the
  <code>tools.jar</code> file from the JDK <code>lib</code> directory
  to your <code>.jedit/jars</code> directory.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Installing the JSwat plugin</h2>

  <p>If you have used a version of the JSwatPlugin prior to 1.3, you
  will have to manually delete the <code>jswat2.jar</code> file from
  the jEdit <code>jars</code> directory. Otherwise you will get
  exceptions when trying to start the plugin.</p>

  <p>To install the plugin, simply copy the jar files from the plugin
  directory to the jEdit <code>jars</code> directory. Then start jEdit
  and the JSwatPlugin should be available in the plugins menu.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Using the JSwat plugin</h2>

  <h3>Setting the JSwat session parameters</h3>

  <p>The following parameters control how the debuggee is started, as
  well as specifying the all-important classpath and sourcepath values.
  These should be familiar as they are the same sort of options
  provided in JSwat itself.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Class Path</strong></dt>

    <dd>The class path to be used when using the &quot;Start VM&quot;
    action. Specify it as you would when using the command line, or use
    the classpath builder by clicking on the associated button.<br />
    Note that this setting is ignored during remote debugging, because
    in this case the classpath of the remote debuggee gets used
    instead.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Source Path</strong></dt>

    <dd>A list of directories to search for source files. This is
    specified the same way as the class path.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Stop in main() method when launching</strong></dt>

    <dd>If selected, JSwat automatically sets a breakpoint at the first
    line of the main method of the main class. This applies only to a
    launched session (action &quot;Start VM&quot;), not a remote
    debugging session (action &quot;Attach to remote VM&quot;).</dd>

    <dt><strong>Raise window upon debugging event</strong></dt>

    <dd>If selected, JSwat tries to raise the jEdit window above other
    windows on your desktop whenever a breakpoint is hit or some other
    debugging event occurred. Note that the behavior of this feature
    depends on the desktop manager you are using. For example, on newer
    Windows systems, this may cause the jEdit entry in the task bar to
    flash (in case it is not already in the foreground).</dd>

    <dt><strong>Shorten class names</strong></dt>

    <dd>If selected, JSwat will strip the package names from class
    names in the Locals, Breakpoints and Stack panel.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Setting/Removing/Disabling breakpoints</h3>

  <p>To set a breakpoint, place the caret on the line you wish to set
  the breakpoint on and select the Toggle Breakpoint action from the
  JSwat plugin menu.</p>

  <p>A blue marker will appear in the gutter next to any lines with
  breakpoints set. If there is a VM session running, and the breakpoint
  class can be resolved, the marker will appear in red.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Only line breakpoints can be set using the
  JSwat plugin. However, method breakpoints can be set using the usual
  JSwat <code>stop</code> command, although the plugin will not be able
  to indicate the location of the breakpoint.</p>

  <p>If a breakpoint has already been set on the caret line, the
  breakpoint will be disabled. This is indicated by a gray marker.</p>

  <p>If the breakpoint on the caret line has already been disabled, the
  breakpoint will be removed.</p>

  <h3>Starting a debugging session</h3>

  <p>To start a debugging session, use may either use remote debugging
  or launched debugging.<br />
  See &quot;<strong>Launching a new debugging session</strong>&quot; or
  &quot;<strong>Attaching to a remote debugging session</strong>&quot;
  below.</p>

  <h3>Launching a new debugging session</h3>

  <p>To launch a new debugging session, select the &quot;Start VM&quot;
  menu item from the JSwat plugin menu. A dialog will be shown with the
  following parameters:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Java Home</strong></dt>

    <dd>The directory in which a JDK is installed, such as
    &quot;c:\jdk1.4.2&quot;</dd>

    <dt><strong>JVM Executable</strong></dt>

    <dd>The name of the JVM executable, such as &quot;java&quot;. The
    path to the JVM executable is assumed to be <code>{Java
    Home}/bin</code>.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Debuggee VM options</strong></dt>

    <dd>Any arguments to be passed to the debuggee VM, such as
    &quot;-classic&quot;. Do not add the &quot;-classpath&quot;
    parameter here, as it will be added by JSwat, according to the
    classpath setting specified in the Global Options dialog.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Set -D Properties</strong></dt>

    <dd>This opens a dialog where you can specify the <code>-D</code>
    options passed to the debuggee VM.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Class name and arguments</strong></dt>

    <dd>This field must start with the fully qualified name of the main
    class of the debuggee application, such as
    <code>org.gjt.sp.jedit.Main</code>.<br />
    Append any command line arguments to be passed to the application.
    These will become the String[] args parameter to the
    <code>main</code> method of the main class specified at the line
    start.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Start VM suspended</strong></dt>

    <dd>If checked, the debugger will not start the application until
    the debuggee is resumed.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Attaching to a remote debugging session</h3>

  <p>To attach to re remote debugging session, select the &quot;Attach
  to remove VM&quot; menu item from the JSwat plugin menu. A dialog
  will be shown with the following parameters:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Transport Type</strong></dt>

    <dd>Choose the transport type that you have chosen to start the
    debuggee application with. JSwat supports socket transport and
    shared memory transport.<br />
    Note that JSwat supports the shared memory connector, when the
    system allows it. This is generally only true for Windows
    systems.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Host</strong></dt>

    <dd>When using socket transport, enter the hostname of the remote
    debuggee. If you leave this field blank, it defaults to
    &quot;localhost&quot;.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Port number</strong></dt>

    <dd>When using socket transport, enter the port number of the
    remote debuggee listening for connection events.<br />
    Typically socket-based debugging means that each time the debugger
    is detached, the debuggee will listen on a new port. To avoid this,
    add &quot;<code>address=1234</code>&quot; to the list of arguments
    to the <code>-Xrunjdwp</code> option. The value is a port number
    between 1 and 65535. Usually port numbers below 1024 are for
    privileged use only. Be sure to choose a port number that is not
    being used by any other socket-based application.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Shared name</strong></dt>

    <dd>When using shared memory transport, enter the shared memory
    name of the remote debuggee here.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Run until line</h3>

  <p>This feature allows you to place a temporary breakpoint on the
  line where the caret is. The target will run until this line (or
  another breakpoint is triggered). Once the temporary breakpoint has
  been triggered, it will be automatically deleted.</p>

  <h3>Get variable value</h3>

  <p>The value of variables can be seen by allowing the mouse pointer
  to hover over a variable name in the source code. If the variable is
  in scope, its value will be displayed as a tooltip.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Building the JSwat plugin</h2>

  <p>The JSwat plugin is built using <a href=
  "http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> and a <code>build.xml</code>
  file is provided for this purpose. You may want to create a
  <code>build.properties</code> file to set some of the build
  properties to suit your environment; in particular, you may want to
  set the <code>install.dir</code> property. See the plugin
  <code>build.xml</code> file for the details.</p>

  <p>You will need to set your <code>CLASSPATH</code> to include the
  jEdit jar file (<code>jedit.jar</code>) so the plugin can find the
  classes it needs.</p>

  <p>To build the plugin, invoke <kbd>ant</kbd> with no arguments. This
  will make the jar files and copy them to the <code>install.dir</code>
  directory. The jar files will need to be in the jEdit
  <code>jars</code> directory for jEdit to find the plugin.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Reporting Problems</h2>

  <p>If you find any problems in JSwat or the plugin, or you have an
  idea for a feature request, please send an email to
  <code>jswat-bugs@bluemarsh.com</code> with as much information as you
  can provide (software versions, environment settings, the
  problem/feature description).</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Revision History</h2>

  <p>1.6 - February 4, 2005 (Dirk Moebius)</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug 898: NPE in
    <code>JEditSourceView.scrollToLine()</code> when the debugger hits
    a breakpoint.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: breakpoint indicators and variable tooltips were not
    shown on the first jEdit view, only on subsequently opened views.
    Generally, JSwatPlugin should now behave better when more than one
    jEdit view is opened. (But you may still open only one JSwat
    instance.)</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: the Ant build file (<code>build.xml</code>) had a
    bug so that the plugin version number of the
    <code>JSwat.props</code> file inside the JSwatPlugin.jar archive
    was not updated correctly when using &quot;<code>ant
    dist</code>&quot; after &quot;<code>ant release</code>&quot;.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: memory hole when unloading and reloading the
    JSwatPlugin (text area decorators were not removed from text
    areas).</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: JSwatPlugin did not use the AWT event thread to open
    files and perform scrolling, resulting in a couple of concurrency
    issues.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: the source distribution files
    <code>JSwatPlugin-src-{version}.tar.gz</code> and
    <code>JSwatPlugin-src-{version}.zip</code>, which are built by
    &quot;<code>ant dist</code>&quot;, wrongly included the class
    binaries. This made them twice as large as they need to be.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>1.5.5 - November 14, 2004</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug 895: breakpoint indicator was not showing in the
    source code viewer.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug 896: toolbar buttons are now enabling and disabling
    appropriately.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>1.5.4 - April 29, 2004 (Dirk Moebius)</p>

  <ul>
    <li>New: Added action &quot;Hotswap Class&quot; to hotswap the
    class surrounding the current cursor position.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: changing the dock position of the JSwat panel
    required a restart of jEdit.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: jEdit would sometimes throw
    IndexOutOfBoundsException if the buffer was shorter than the
    current debug position.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: Invoking a JSwatPlugin action before the JSwat panel
    was docked for the first time threw a NullPointerException.</li>

    <li>If the user opens a second jEdit view, display a message in the
    dock panel saying that only one instance of JSwatPlugin is
    allowed.</li>

    <li>BeanShell scripts can now invoke JSwat commands by calling
    <code>com.bluemarsh.jswat.plugins.jedit.JSwatPlugin
    .invokeJSwatCommand(View view, String command)</code>.</li>

    <li>Renamed action &quot;Dock JSwat Plugin&quot; to &quot;Show
    JSwat Plugin&quot; (associated shortcuts remain the same).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>1.5(.0-3) - February 16, 2004 (Dirk Moebius)</p>

  <ul>
    <li>New: Remote debugging (actions &quot;Attach to remote VM&quot;
    and &quot;Detach from remote VM&quot;).</li>

    <li>New: Now opens source files in source file archives. You can
    now specify source file archives in the source path (ZIP or JAR
    files). For this feature, the Archive plugin is required (version
    0.3.3 or higher), otherwise you will get an error message when the
    debugger tries to open such a file.</li>

    <li>Updated to work with JSwat 2.21. Now requires jEdit 4.1pre1 or
    higher.</li>

    <li>Reworked options panel; the launch properties (Java home etc.)
    have been moved to the &quot;Start VM&quot; action; new JSwat
    options &quot;Stop in main() when launching&quot;, &quot;Raise
    window upon debugging event&quot; and &quot;Shorten class
    names&quot;; the plugin now shares its settings with an installed
    JSwat standalone application.</li>

    <li>Actions &quot;Add Breakpoint&quot; and &quot;Remove
    Breakpoint&quot; in the JSwat plugin menu replaced by a single
    action &quot;Toggle Breakpoint&quot;. You might need to reassign
    jEdit shortcuts.</li>

    <li>Breakpoints shown in the text area gutter are now displayed
    with an appropriate color: red for resolved, blue for unresolved,
    gray for disabled (same as in JSwat standalone).</li>

    <li>The current debugging line is now indicated with a red
    highlight. In previous versions, the plugin used jEdit&#39;s
    current line indicator for this. This was inappropriate, because
    you could move the cursor somewhere else and you would lose your
    debugging position.</li>

    <li>The JSwat plugin now may be docked into the bottom or top area.
    In this case, the two split panes are displayed side-by-side.</li>

    <li>JSwat debugging log information is now dumped to a file
    jswat.log in the user&#39;s home, instead of the activity log. This
    is faster.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: setting breakpoint after changing the current buffer
    did not work. This appears to have fixed bug 735 as well.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug 738: moved initialization out of <code>start()</code>
    method so plugin will launch faster.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: breakpoints in inner classes now work.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: variable tooltip did not show null values.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug: help document README.html did not show up in jEdit
    Help.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>1.4 - November 10, 2003</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug 737: breakpoint indicator now appears and disappears
    immediately, rather than when the text area just happened to be
    repainted.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug 773: VM start dialog ignored the Java home and
    application parameters values.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>1.3 - March 9, 2003</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Added &quot;Help&quot; menu item to the JSwat plugin menu, so
    the JSwat help can now be accessed.</li>

    <li>Looks for the JPDA classes on startup and reports an error if
    they are not found.</li>

    <li>Replaced the red colored toolbar buttons; they clashed with the
    predominantly blue-colored buttons.</li>

    <li>Put the classes in a proper package
    (com.bluemarsh.jswat.plugins.jedit), conforming with Java coding
    standards.</li>

    <li>Now remembers the position of the split-pane divider.</li>

    <li>Installed plugin in the JSwat source tree under
    <code>plugins/jedit</code>. It is now part of the JSwat
    project.</li>

    <li>Removed copious amounts of unnecessary, duplicate, and/or
    defunct code, and filled in some missing pieces.</li>

    <li>Breakpoints panel said &quot;junk&quot; because it was not
    initialized properly. This change also fixed the other problems
    with the breakpoints panel.</li>

    <li>Removed debugging messages from output panel.</li>

    <li>Added edit popup menus to text areas and text fields.</li>

    <li>Removed dependence on CommonControls classes; use the class in
    JSwat that provides specialized functionality.</li>

    <li>Added &quot;New&quot; button to toolbar to start debuggee.</li>

    <li>After switching buffer, adapter still used old class name for
    setting breakpoints.</li>
  </ul>
