  <h2>JSwat Unit Testing</h2>

  <h3>Unit Tests Defined</h3>

  <p>Unit tests are basically bits of code that exercise functions
  within a project. If each test cases passes, there is a good chance
  the system is in proper working order. That is by no means
  guaranteed, and verifying this falls into the realm of integration
  testing, and which is performed manually.</p>

  <p>The JSwat unit tests are written to use the
  <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> framework. This provides
  the classes for automating the execution of the tests, making it very
  easy to run the tests over and over again.</p>

  <h3>Running the Tests</h3>

  <p>To run the test suite you will need the latest version of the
  <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> tool. While the
  process could be accomplished without Ant, it would take longer to
  explain than it does to install this extraordinarily useful tool.
  After installing Ant, you will need to copy the
  <code>junit.jar</code> file (which you get from the JUnit
  <a href="http://www.junit.org/">website</a>) to the <code>lib</code>
  directory in the Ant installation directory. In this way, Ant can
  easily run JUnit tests using the <code>junit</code> tag.</p>

  <p>With Ant installed and JSwat
  <a href="../dev/compile.html">compiled</a>, running the unit tests is
  a simple process. Open a command shell window and change to the
  top-level JSwat directory (where the <code>README.html</code> file is
  found). From there, invoke Ant with the &quot;test&quot; target, like
  so: <code>ant test</code></p>

  <p>Soon after invoking this command you will see the JSwat window
  appear and start reacting to the test code. Wait until the window
  closes and Ant has finished running the tests.</p>

  <p>It is important that the tests are performed in the top-level
  directory. Otherwise many of the tests will fail to work correctly.
  In particular, the classpath and sourcepath are set using relative
  paths, and the Java parser test uses a relative file path to load one
  of the test files.</p>

  <h3>Writing New Tests</h3>

  <p>The best way to learn about writing test cases is to look at the
  existing test code. It is generally very simple and straight-forward
  code. Bear in mind that any new test cases must be added to the
  appropriate collection (e.g. <code>AllTests</code>,
  <code>ActiveTests</code>, etc.) within the particular Java package.
  Otherwise they will not be run when the test suite is executed.</p>
