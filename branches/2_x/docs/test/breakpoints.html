    <title>JSwat - Testing Breakpoints</title>
  </head>

  <body bgcolor="#ffffff">
    <h1>Testing Breakpoints</h1>

    <h2>Breakpoints Manager Dialog</h2>

    <p>Start these tests by bringing up the breakpoints manager dialog,
    which is found under the &quot;Breakpoints&quot; menu as the menu
    item &quot;List Breakpoints...&quot;. These are also found in the
    &quot;Breakpoints&quot; panel.</p>

    <h3>Breakpoints list</h3>

    <p>This dialog/panel shows a list of the defined breakpoints. Its
    contents should be the same as the output from the
    &quot;<code>stop</code>&quot; command. Double-clicking on a
    breakpoint in the list should present the breakpoint properties
    dialog.</p>

    <h3>New Breakpoint...</h3>

    <p>Presents an identical dialog to that described <a
    href="actions.html#setBreak">here</a>. Use that test case to test
    this dialog. After adding a breakpoint, it should appear in the
    &quot;Default&quot; breakpoint group in the manager dialog.</p>

    <h3>New Group...</h3>

    <p>Presents a dialog asking the user for a breakpoint group name
    and a select box to choose the group&#39;s parent group.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ok with empty fields - complains about missing name.</li>

      <li>Ok with group name - creates new breakpoint group.</li>

      <li>Ok with name and non-default group parent - creates group
      under the selected parent group.</li>

      <li>Ok button.</li>

      <li>Cancel button.</li>

      <li>Dialog close button.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Properties...</h3>

    <p>Presents a dialog showing the selected breakpoints
    properties.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Invoke with no breakpoint selected - does nothing</li>

      <li>Invoke with only a breakpoint group selected - does
      nothing.</li>

      <li>Invoke with a breakpoint selected, dialog will then
      appear.</li>

      <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
          <li>Attempt to type non-digits in numeric fields - input will
          be ignored.</li>

          <li>Toggle the enabled checkbox and select Ok to observe
          change in breakpoint state.</li>

          <li>Change the breakpoint&#39;s group and select Ok to
          observe as it moves to the new group in the breakpoint tree
          display.</li>

          <li>Ok button.</li>

          <li>Cancel button.</li>

          <li>Dialog close button.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disable</h3>

    <p>Disables the selected breakpoint or breakpoint group.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Invoke with nothing selected - nothing happens.</li>

      <li>Invoke with breakpoint group selected - group and all
      contained breakoints and groups are disabled.</li>

      <li>Invoke with breakpoint selected - becomes disabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Enable</h3>

    <p>Enables the selected breakpoint or breakpoint group.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Invoke with nothing selected - nothing happens.</li>

      <li>Invoke with breakpoint group selected - group and all
      contained breakoints and groups are enabled.</li>

      <li>Invoke with breakpoint selected - becomes enabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Remove</h3>

    <p>Removes the selected breakpoint or breakpoint group.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Invoke with nothing selected - nothing happens.</li>

      <li>Invoke with breakpoint group selected - group and all
      contained breakoints and groups are removed.</li>

      <li>Invoke with breakpoint selected - breakpoint is removed.</li>

      <li>Note, cannot remove the &quot;Default&quot; breakpoint
      group.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setting Breakpoints</h2>

    <p>This section is to confirm that breakpoints can be set in a
    class and will cause execution to halt at that point.</p>

    <h3>When to Set</h3>

    <p>Create a breakpoint before starting VM and see that it resolves
    correctly. Create a breakpoint after starting VM and see that it
    resolves immediately (at least it typically will). Change
    breakpoint settings during an active session and ensure they take
    effect. Disable the breakpoint and re-enable; it should resolve
    again.</p>

    <h3>Non-code lines</h3>

    <p>Set a line breakpoint at a line with no executable code. If
    session inactive, start the session and breakpoint resolution error
    will be displayed (the VM will stop). If the session is active, an
    error message should indicate that the line was not found.</p>

    <h3>Suspend policy</h3>

    <p>Breakpoints support a suspend policy in which all threads, the
    event thread, or no threads will be suspended when the breakpoint
    is hit. Try the three options to make sure they work.</p>

    <h3>Skipping</h3>

    <p>Start by setting a breakpoint at a point in the test code that
    will be executed many times. Now change the breakpoint to have a
    skip count greater than zero. Observe as the breakpoint is not hit
    the first skip-count times. This test should be done with code that
    prints something to the screen each time the code is executed, so
    that the skip test can be easily confirmed (<em>iotest, for
    loop</em>).</p>

    <h3>Expiration</h3>

    <p>Start by setting a breakpoint at a point in the test code that
    will be executed many times. Now change the breakpoint to have an
    expire count greater than zero. Observe as the breakpoint stops
    halting execution after expire-count times. This test should be
    done with code that prints something to the screen each time the
    code is executed, so that the expire test can be easily confirmed
    (<em>iotest, for loop</em>).</p>

    <h3>Disabled</h3>

    <p>Create a breakpoint at a point in the test code that will be
    executed several times. Have the breakpoint halt execution at least
    once to confirm that it works. Then change the breakpoint to be
    disabled and ensure that the code is not halted since the
    breakpoint is now disabled.</p>

    <h3>Disabled by group</h3>

    <p>Create a breakpoint at a point in the test code that will be
    executed several times. Have the breakpoint halt execution at least
    once to confirm that it works. Then change the breakpoint&#39;s
    parent group to be disabled and ensure that the code is not halted
    since the breakpoint is now effectively disabled.</p>

    <h3>Default group auto-enables</h3>

    <p>The &quot;Default&quot; breakpoint is special in a number of
    ways. First, it can never be removed. Second, it is automatically
    disabled when the session is started. Confirm this by starting a
    session, disabling the default group, finishing the session, and
    then starting the same session over again. The default group should
    be renabled again.</p>

    <h2>Conditions</h2>

    <p>Breakpoints support simple conditionals based on the value of
    variables. Test this by setting a breakpoint inside a
    <code>for</code> loop. Set the condition to be a value of the index
    variable. Ensure that execution stops just the one time through the
    loop when the index variable equals the condition value.</p>

    <p>Other things to try:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Compare to a &#39;null&#39; value.</li>

      <li>Compare a numeric value.</li>

      <li>Compare a string value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Monitors</h2>

    <p>Breakpoints support basic monitors, which are simply commands.
    Each time the breakpoint stops, the command is executed just as if
    the user entered it. Test this by supplying a monitor of
    &quot;stdout hello&quot; when a certain breakpoint is hit. Ensure
    that the output from the <code>stdout</code> command is displayed
    when the breakpoint is hit.</p>

    <p>Other things to try:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Run a command.</li>

      <li>Run an aliased command.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Saving Breakpoints</h2>

    <p>JSwat automatically saves the defined breakpoints and breakpoint
    groups between invocations of the program. Use the following test
    scenario to confirm the proper saving of the breakpoints.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Set some breakpoints in the debuggee VM, putting them in
      multiple breakpoint groups.</li>

      <li>Close the debuggee VM and close JSwat.</li>

      <li>Restart JSwat and confirm the breakpoints are still
      there.</li>
    </ol>
