    <title>JSwat - Testing Panels</title>
  </head>

  <body bgcolor="#ffffff">
    <h1>Testing Panels</h1>

    <h2>Threads panel</h2>

    <p>This panel displays the live threads in the debuggee VM. As
    threads are created and destroyed, entries in this table will
    appear and disappear. The thread currently being examined by JSwat
    will be rendered in red. Simply clicking on a row in the table will
    change JSwat&#39;s notion of the current thread. The rows are not
    sorted in any particular order.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initially the table is empty.</li>

      <li>After launching a debuggee VM, several new rows should
      appear. The threads will likely be called: Finalizer, Reference
      Handler, Signal dispatcher, and main.</li>

      <li>Hitting a breakpoint should set a thread as the current one,
      which paints the corresponding row in this panel as red.</li>

      <li>Using the &#39;<code>thrdtest</code>&#39; test program should
      cause several threads to be created and eventually to die.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Classes panel</h2>

    <p>This panel displays the loaded classes in the debuggee VM. As
    classes are loaded and unloaded, entries in this tree will appear
    and disappear. Double-clicking on a class in the tree should
    display the corresponding source file. The entries tend to be
    sorted in alphabetical order, but that is not guaranteed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initially the tree is empty, with a single node whose label
      is &quot;CLASSES&quot;.</li>

      <li>After launching a debuggee VM, numerous new nodes should
      appear.</li>

      <li>When a debuggee VM starts running, this tree should rebuild
      itself several times as new classes are loaded into the debuggee
      VM. It is normal for the expanded branches of the tree to
      collapse as the tree is rebuilt.</li>

      <li>Expanding a node and hovering the mouse over a class should
      display a tooltip with the class&#39; fully-qualified name.</li>

      <li>Hovering the mouse over empty space should show a tooltip
      with the phrase &quot;class tree&quot; (or some translation
      thereof).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Locals panel</h2>

    <p>This panel displays the local variables in the current stack
    frame of the debuggee VM, when the debuggee VM is suspended. The
    tree rebuilds itself as the frame, thread, or location changes in
    the debuggee VM. Expanded nodes in the tree will remain expanded
    even when the tree is rebuilt (unless, of course, the variable goes
    out of scope).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initially the tree is empty, with a single node whose label
      is &quot;LOCALS&quot;.</li>

      <li>While the debuggee VM is running, the locals panel will
      likely display &quot;(thread not set)&quot; to indicate that the
      current thread is not set.</li>

      <li>When the debuggee VM is suspended and a current thread is set
      (possibly by using the Threads panel), the locals panel should
      display the visible variables at the current location.</li>

      <li>Variables in the tree have this basic format: <code>name
      (type): value</code>. The type may be a primitive Java type or a
      Java class name. Class names may be fully-qualified depending on
      the &quot;Trim package names&quot; option set in the
      Preferences.</li>

      <li>Objects are shown using a diamond-shaped box icon.</li>

      <li>Java objects will have their fields displayed as child nodes
      in the tree.</li>

      <li>Object fields that refer back to the containing object,
      either directly or indirectly, will be shown with a circular
      icon. These nodes cannot be expanded.</li>

      <li>Arrays will be shown with an icon that resembles a table with
      three rows. The value of the array is the size of the array in
      square brackets.</li>

      <li>Arrays longer than six elements will have a special
      &quot;...&quot; node. Double-clicking on this node will display
      all of the elements in the array.</li>

      <li>Recently changed variables will be colored in red.</li>

      <li>Test all of this behavior rigorously with the
      &#39;<code>locals</code>&#39; test application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Watches panel</h2>

    <p>This panel displays any defined watches. Watches are variables
    in the debuggee VM that JSwat is presently tracking for changes. As
    a variable is changed, the value displayed in this panel will be
    updated.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initially the table is empty.</li>

      <li>After the debuggee VM is loaded, the table will contain an
      empty row.</li>

      <li>If any watches had been previously defined, they will be
      shown.</li>

      <li>An empty row will exist at all times.</li>

      <li>Typing the name of a visible variable into the
      &quot;Name&quot; column of the empty row will add that variable
      as a watch.</li>

      <li>Typing the name of a local or field variable while stopped in
      a static method should work. Previously this did not.</li>

      <li>The keyword &quot;<code>this</code>&quot; may be used to
      refer to field variables of the &#39;this&#39; object in the
      current stack frame. This is only useful if a local variable of
      the same name is present in the stack frame.</li>

      <li>Variable values are displayed simply as the
      <code>toString()</code> of the object.</li>

      <li>Clearing the name field of a row will delete the watch.</li>

      <li>While the debuggee VM is running, the locals panel will
      likely display &quot;(no thread)&quot; to indicate that the
      current thread is not set.</li>

      <li>If no variable information is available (because the classes
      were not compiled using &quot;javac -g&quot;) then the panel will
      display &quot;(no debugging info)&quot;.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Messages panel</h2>

    <p>This panel displays the messages generated by JSwat during the
    program&#39;s current run. Right-clicking on the panel will display
    a popup menu allowing the user to copy the selected text in the
    display.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initially the panel will display a few startup messages.</li>

      <li>As the program goes through its normal operating procedures,
      messages will be relayed to this panel.</li>

      <li>As messages are displayed to this panel, it should
      automatically scroll down to the new messages.</li>

      <li>Commands entered into the command input field will be echoed
      in this panel (prefixed with a <code>&gt;</code>).</li>

      <li>Select some text from this display and right-click. A popup
      menu should appear with three items - Clear, Copy, and Select
      All. Test the Copy item by selecting it and pasting the text from
      the clipboard into a text editor.</li>

      <li>Deselect the text in the panel and right-click. The popup
      menu described above will appear. The Copy item will be
      disabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Command text field</h2>

    <p>This text field appears below the Messages panel and allows the
    user to enter JSwat commands. Pressing the Enter key should send
    the typed input to JSwat for processing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initially this field is empty.</li>

      <li>Typing into this field should echo all typed characters.</li>

      <li>Pressing Enter will send the typed input to the command
      interpreter. This should also clear the input field of all
      text.</li>

      <li>Right-clicking in the input field should display a popup menu
      with two items - Copy, Paste.</li>

      <li>Right-click in the input field when no text is selected. A
      popup menu will appear containing a &quot;Copy&quot; entry that
      is disabled.</li>

      <li>Right-click in the input field when text is selected. A popup
      menu will appear containing an enabled &quot;Copy&quot; entry.
      Select this to send the selected text to the system
      clipboard.</li>

      <li>Right-click in the input field after having copied text to
      the system clipboard. The &quot;Paste&quot; menu item should be
      enabled. Select it to paste the text to the input field.</li>

      <li>Using cursor up and down keys should scroll through the
      command history.</li>

      <li>Using Ctrl-p and Ctrl-n keys should scroll through the
      command history.</li>

      <li>Cursoring up to the top of the command history will generate
      a beep sound.</li>

      <li>Cursoring down to the bottom of the command history will
      restore whatever &quot;in-progress&quot; text was there
      initially.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Output panel</h2>

    <p>This panel displays the output generated by debuggee VM during
    the program&#39;s run. Right-clicking on the panel will display a
    popup menu allowing the user to copy the selected text in the
    display.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initially the panel will be empty.</li>

      <li>Each time a debuggee VM is loaded, this panel will be
      cleared.</li>

      <li>As the debuggee VM generates output (both to
      <code>stdout</code> and to <code>stderr</code>), that output will
      be relayed to this panel.</li>

      <li>As output is generated, this panel should automatically
      scroll down to the new output.</li>

      <li>Select some text from this display and right-click. A popup
      menu should appear with three items - Clear, Copy, and Select
      All. Test the Copy item by selecting it and pasting the text from
      the clipboard into a text editor.</li>

      <li>Deselect the text in the panel and right-click. The popup
      menu described above will appear. The Copy item will be
      disabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Input text field</h2>

    <p>This text field appears below the Output panel and allows the
    user to enter input to the debuggee VM. Pressing the Enter key
    should send the typed input to the debuggee VM&#39;s
    <code>stdin</code> stream.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initially this field is empty.</li>

      <li>Typing into this field should echo all typed characters.</li>

      <li>Pressing Enter will send the typed input to the debuggee
      VM&#39;s <code>stdin</code> stream. This should also clear the
      input field of all text.</li>

      <li>Right-clicking in the input field should display a popup menu
      with two items - Copy, Paste.</li>

      <li>Right-click in the input field when no text is selected. A
      popup menu will appear containing a &quot;Copy&quot; entry that
      is disabled.</li>

      <li>Right-click in the input field when text is selected. A popup
      menu will appear containing an enabled &quot;Copy&quot; entry.
      Select this to send the selected text to the system
      clipboard.</li>

      <li>Right-click in the input field after having copied text to
      the system clipboard. The &quot;Paste&quot; menu item should be
      enabled. Select it to paste the text to the input field.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Breakpoints panel</h2>

    <p>The breakpoints panel is identical to the breakpoints dialog
    (accept, of course, that it cannot be closed). See the breakpoints
    <a href="breakpoints.html">checklist</a> for testing the features
    of the breakpoints panel.</p>

    <h2>Stack panel</h2>

    <p>This panel displays the stack frame at the current location in
    the debuggee VM.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initially this panel is empty.</li>

      <li>
        After the debuggee VM is loaded, this panel may display one of
        the following messages: 

        <ul>
          <li>(no frame) = current stack frame is empty.</li>

          <li>(no thread) = no current thread set.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>The rows in the table will be numbered in ascending order
      starting from one. These numbers will appear in the &quot;#&quot;
      column.</li>

      <li>Native methods in the stack frame will show &quot;native
      method&quot; in the &quot;Source&quot; column.</li>

      <li>The row colored in red indicates which frame is the current
      one. This is usually the frame numbered &#39;1&#39;.</li>

      <li>Double-clicking on a row in the table will set the current
      stack frame and show the corresponding source file, if available,
      as well as scroll to the point in the source file that defines
      that location.</li>

      <li>Double-clicking on a row in the table for which the method is
      &quot;native&quot; will display the corresponding source file,
      but not scroll to the appropriate location, since it is not
      known.</li>

      <li>Double-clicking on a row in the table for which a source file
      could not be found will display an appropriate error
      message.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods panel</h2>

    <p>This panel displays the defined methods of the class that
    defines the method at the current location. Each row of the table
    corresponds to a method in the class.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Initially this panel is empty.</li>

      <li>
        After the debuggee VM is loaded, this panel may display one of
        the following messages: 

        <ul>
          <li>(no frame) = current stack frame is empty.</li>

          <li>(no thread) = no current thread set.</li>

          <li>(bad thread state) = thread is not suspended</li>

          <li>(native) = current method is native and no stack frame is
          available</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>The line number in the source file where the method is
      defined is shown in the &quot;Line&quot; column.</li>

      <li>If the method location is not defined, the line number will
      be shown as &quot;??&quot; in the &quot;Line&quot; column.</li>

      <li>If the method is native, the line number will be shown as
      &quot;-1&quot; in the &quot;Line&quot; column.</li>

      <li>The method modifiers, return type, name, and argument list
      are shown in the &quot;Method&quot; column.</li>

      <li>As the current location is changed, the contents of this
      panel will change to reflect the methods defined in the class
      containing the current location.</li>

      <li>Double-clicking on a row in the table will show the
      corresponding source file, if available, and scroll to make that
      method visible in the source view.</li>

      <li>Double-clicking on a row in the table for which the method is
      &quot;native&quot; will display the corresponding source file,
      but not scroll to the appropriate location, since it is not
      known.</li>

      <li>Double-clicking on a row in the table for which a source file
      could not be found will display an appropriate error
      message.</li>
    </ul>
