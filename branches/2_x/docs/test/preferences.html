    <title>JSwat - Testing Preferences</title>
  </head>

  <body bgcolor="#ffffff">
    <h2>Testing Preferences</h2>

    <p>Basically the the preferences consists of a set of checkboxes in
    a menu, and a dialog of various options. Changing values and
    clicking &quot;Ok&quot; in the preferences dialog should have an
    immediate effect on the program. Since there are many options, this
    checklist will not elaborate on the test cases. Instead, the tester
    should practice changing options and observing their affect on the
    program.</p>

    <h4>Exceptions to the rule</h4>

    <p>Regarding the rule of preference changes taking effect
    immediately, please note the following exceptions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Source view colorization</li>

      <li>Source view parsing option</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Things to try</h3>

    <p>Below are some items to try to verify that the preferences are
    working at the most basic level.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Source view font and size</li>

      <li>Shorten class names</li>

      <li>Show toolbar</li>
    </ul>
