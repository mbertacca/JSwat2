    <title>JSwat - Starting JSwat</title>

    <h2>Starting JSwat</h2>

    <h3>Startup Options</h3>

    <p>There are several options available when starting the program.
    Most notable is that JSwat can execute an arbitrary command when
    given appropriate arguments on the command line.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>java com.bluemarsh.jswat.Main</code></dt>

      <dd>Program should launch as usual.</dd>

      <dt><code>java -Djava.source.path=/usr/java/src
      com.bluemarsh.jswat.Main</code></dt>

      <dd>Program should launch with sourcepath pre-defined. Test this
      by invoking the &#39;<code>sourcepath</code>&#39; command and
      verifying that the output contains
      <code>/usr/java/src</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>java com.bluemarsh.jswat.Main &lt;command&gt;
      [&lt;arguments&gt;]</code></dt>

      <dd>Program will start and execute the given command with any
      arguments provided.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Console Mode</h4>

    <p>JSwat supports more than one interface mode. At present the
    program defaults to running with a graphical interface based on the
    JFC component set. In addition, the program can be made to run
    within a console, without any graphical interface at all. This mode
    is invoked with the <code>-console</code> option. It must be the
    first option following the JSwat &quot;Main&quot; class name. Use
    the following test cases to test the console-only mode of the
    program.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>java com.bluemarsh.jswat.Main -console</code></dt>

      <dd>Program should launch into console mode.</dd>

      <dt><code>java -Djava.source.path=/usr/java/src
      com.bluemarsh.jswat.Main -console</code></dt>

      <dd>Program should launch with sourcepath pre-defined. Test this
      by invoking the &#39;<code>sourcepath</code>&#39; command and
      verifying that the output contains
      <code>/usr/java/src</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>java com.bluemarsh.jswat.Main -console &lt;command&gt;
      [&lt;arguments&gt;]</code></dt>

      <dd>Program will start and execute the given command with any
      arguments provided.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Startup Files</h3>

    <p>Upon starting, JSwat looks for a file named
    <code>jswat.init</code> in the current directory. If it finds it, it
    reads each line as if it were a JSwat command. Lines beginning with
    <code>#</code> are ignored.</p>

    <h4>Unreadable</h4>

    <p>For this test, make an unreadable <code>jswat.init</code> file.
    This is easily done by changing the owner and/or permissions on the
    file using normal file commands (e.g. &quot;chmod&quot;). Start
    JSwat in this directory and ensure that it does not read the
    contents of the file.</p>

    <h4>Parent Directories</h4>

    <p>JSwat not only reads the <code>jswat.init</code> file in the
    current directory but also all parent directories. Test this by
    putting a file in each parent directory, each with a unique
    command. Start JSwat and ensure that each command was run in
    turn.</p>
