    <title>JSwat - Path Testing</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Testing Paths</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Path testing is nothing more than ensuring that JSwat handles
    the classpath and sourcepath correctly. This document serves a dual
    purpose: it documents how the paths should be handled, and it
    describes how to verify that JSwat is working as expected.</p>

    <p>Both the classpath and sourcepath are maintained by the
    <code>PathManager</code> class. It stores the paths in session
    properties.</p>

    <h2>How it should work</h2>

    <h3>Classpath</h3>

    <p>The classpath session property can be modified under two
    conditions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The user specifically sets the path using either the
      <code>classpath</code> command or the &quot;Set Classpath&quot;
      dialog.</li>

      <li>The classpath session property is empty when JSwat starts. It
      is automatically set to the value of the
      <code>java.class.path</code> system property.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>While the JSwat session is active, the classpath will appear to
    be that of the debuggee VM. After the session is deactivated, the
    classpath will return to the value before the session was
    activated.</p>

    <h3>Sourcepath</h3>

    <p>The sourcepath session property can be modified under two
    conditions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The user specifically sets the path using either the
      <code>sourcepath</code> command or the &quot;Set Sourcepath&quot;
      dialog.</li>

      <li>The <code>java.source.path</code> system property is set when
      JSwat starts, in which case this value will overwrite the
      sourcepath session property .</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to test</h2>

    <h3>Remote Debuggee</h3>

    <p>Ensure that the classpath session property is not overwritten by
    simply connecting to a remote debuggee. This is accomplished using
    the following steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Set the classpath to something memorable.</li>

      <li>Attach to a remote debuggee that has a different classpath
      than the one used in the previous step.</li>

      <li>Check that the classpath is indeed different.</li>

      <li>Disconnect from the remote debuggee.</li>

      <li>Verify that the classpath is the original value.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Setting the Paths</h3>

    <p>See the appropriate command and dialog test cases to learn how
    to test setting the classpath and sourcepath.</p>
