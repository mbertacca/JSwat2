  <h2>How to Compile and Run JSwat</h2>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>

  <p>JSwat depends on the Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA).
  See the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/">JPDA website</a>
  for more information. The required classes are generally found in a
  file called <code>tools.jar</code> which is located in the
  <code>lib</code> directory of your JDK. Fortunately, the JSwat build
  files automatically include this file in the classpath, so you do not
  have to take any action at this time.</p>

  <h3>Compiling JSwat</h3>

  <p>To compile JSwat you will need the latest version of the <a href=
  "http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> tool. Download and install
  this tool before continuing. Granted, you could compile JSwat without
  Ant, but it would take longer to explain than it would for you to
  install Ant.</p>

  <p>Compile JSwat by invoking &#39;<code>ant build</code>&#39; on the
  command line.</p>

  <h3>Running JSwat</h3>

  <p>To run JSwat, use the command &#39;<code>ant run</code>&#39; and
  it will start after a few seconds. As with compiling, you could run
  JSwat without Ant, but you would not want to once you knew how.</p>
