    <h2>How Breakpoints Work</h2>

    <h3>Class Diagram</h3>

    <p>For an overview of the classes involved, see the
    <code>breakpoints.dia</code> file. This is a diagram created with
    GNU Dia, a GNOME Linux application.</p>

    <h3>Breakpoint Groups</h3>

    <p>Breakpoint groups are collections of breakpoints. They can be
    modified as a whole, which is convenient for users setting lots of
    breakpoints.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Disabling a breakpoint group will mean that the breakpoints
      in the group can not truly be enabled. Their state may be enabled
      but they will remain effectively disabled so long as the parent
      group is disabled.</li>

      <li>There will be a &quot;Default&quot; breakpoint group into
      which all new breakpoints are placed. This group will always be
      enabled when a new session starts.</li>

      <li>The breakpoint manager will hold the list of breakpoint
      groups, inside which all of the breakpoints will reside.</li>

      <li>Breakpoint groups can be inside other breakpoint groups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Breakpoints</h3>

    <p>Breakpoints are those objects that cause execution to halt in
    the debuggee process. They can be set in any class at any line of
    executable code.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Breakpoints have several states: unresolved, disabled,
      expired, skipping</li>

      <li>The &#39;stop&#39; command will still work, but creates only
      a simple breakpoint. More complex options must be configured
      through breakpoint dialog.</li>

      <li>Breakpoints will support more than one conditional. For the
      breakpoint to halt execution, all of the conditionals must be
      satisfied.</li>

      <li>Breakpoints will keep track of how many times they were
      hit.</li>

      <li>Breakpoints should probably have colors associated with their
      states, so various UI components are consistent overall. Make a
      method for getting the breakpoint&#39;s &quot;color&quot;, so
      other classes are easier to write.</li>

      <li>Breakpoints will support more than one monitor. A monitor is
      an action that will be performed whenever the breakpoint should
      stop.</li>

      <li>Breakpoints define a shouldResume() method that tells whether
      or not the execution of the debuggee VM should remain halted.
      This is called when a BreakpointEvent has occurred in the
      debuggee VM. This method will first check if the breakpoint has
      expired or not. Then it will check the set of conditionals to see
      if the conditions are satisfied.</li>

      <li>The breakpoint has a shouldResume() method that returns true
      if the conditions are not satisfactory for the breakpoint to
      cause the debuggee VM to stop executing.</li>

      <li>The breakpoint defines a performStop() method should be
      called when the breakpoint has been &quot;hit&quot; so that
      monitors are executed.</li>

      <li>Breakpoints need a reset() method to reset all the counts to
      zero and return it to unresolved state. This will not affect the
      enabled state.</li>

      <li>When the session deactivates, the breakpoints are all
      reset.</li>

      <li>When the same session begins again, the breakpoints need to
      prepare to resolve themselves.</li>

      <li>Breakpoint manager needs to re-enable itself when the session
      activates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to set a breakpoint</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>UI layer gets a breakpoint setting request, such as an
      invocation of the &#39;set&#39; command or the SetBreakAction.
      This calls on the BreakpointManager to create the appropriate
      breakpoint.</li>

      <li>The breakpoint is created and inserted into the list of
      breakpoints in the breakpoint manager&#39;s &quot;default&quot;
      breakpoint group.</li>

      <li>Breakpoint manager will attempt to resolve the breakpoint
      immediately.</li>

      <li>The breakpoint classes are responsible for dealing with the
      mechanics of resolving themselves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How breakpoints are resolved</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>BreakpointManager listens for class prepare events whenever
      necessary. If there are no breakpoints, it will not listen. When
      a new breakpoint is created during an active session, the manager
      must start listening.</li>

      <li>
        Types of breakpoints and what they need to resolve. 

        <ul>
          <li>watchpoint: Field, ReferenceType, optional class/thread
          filters</li>

          <li>breakpoint: Location, ReferenceType, optional thread
          filter</li>

          <li>exception: ReferenceType, optional class/thread
          filters</li>

          <li>class prepare/unload: none, optional class filter</li>

          <li>method entry/exit: none, optional class/thread
          filters</li>

          <li>thread start/death: none, optional thread filter</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>ResolvableBreakpoint is an abstract subclass of
      DefaultBreakpoint, which resolves itself against a
      ReferenceType.</li>

      <li>When a new breakpoint is created, it will be asked to try to
      resolve immediately. If it is unsuccessful, an appropriate event
      request is created. The event request will contain a property
      called &quot;breakpoint&quot; that refers to the breakpoint that
      created it. This is used by the breakpoint manager to look up the
      breakpoint that created the request.</li>

      <li>The breakpoint manager listens for class prepare events. When
      one occurs it will look up the &quot;breakpoint&quot; that
      requested the event. If one exists, it will be asked to
      resolve.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What happens when an event occurs</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>VMEventManager gets the event and sends it off to the event
      listeners.</li>

      <li>Each breakpoint class must listen for the events it is
      interested in. This is easier than having a single class listen
      for all types of events.</li>

      <li>Breakpoint receives the event notification and compares the
      value of the &quot;breakpoint&quot; property of the EventRequest
      that generated this event. If it matches, the shouldResume()
      method is called to determine whether to continue the debuggee VM
      or not.</li>

      <li>If the breakpoint should stop, the performStop() method
      should be called so it will increment the stopped counter and run
      any registered monitors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How breakpoints are customized</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Breakpoint dialog iterates breakpoint groups and shows a tree
      of breakpoints in the dialog. For each breakpoint group, a group
      node is created. For each breakpoint, a breakpoint (leaf) node is
      created.</li>

      <li>
        Buttons on the side of the breakpoints dialog allow the user to
        modify the breakpoints. The buttons will include: 

        <ul>
          <li>&quot;Properties...&quot;</li>

          <li>&quot;Show Source&quot;</li>

          <li>&quot;Disable&quot;</li>

          <li>&quot;Enable&quot;</li>

          <li>&quot;Remove&quot;</li>

          <li>&quot;New Breakpoint...&quot;</li>

          <li>&quot;New Group...&quot;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>The create button will bring up the SetBreak action, for
      now.</li>

      <li>Someday the create button will need to have clones that
      create other types of breakpoints (i.e. &quot;create watch&quot;,
      &quot;create catch&quot;).</li>

      <li>The tree uses custom node objects to keep a reference from
      the tree node to the breakpoint group or breakpoint.</li>

      <li>The tree nodes must have custom renderers to show the
      breakpoint or group status (resolved, disabled, etc.).</li>

      <li>Each breakpoint subclass must provide an accessor method,
      getUIAdapter(), that returns an appropriate user interface
      adapter (which implements the UIAdapter interface).</li>

      <li>The UI adapter will have a JComponent widget that contains
      the user interface widget(s). The UI adapter will have a commit()
      method to save the widget values to the breakpoint, condition, or
      monitor.</li>

      <li>The breakpoint manager dialog builds a breakpoint editor
      dialog and stuffs the breakpoint&#39;s UI into this editor
      dialog, including any monitors and conditions for the
      breakpoint.</li>

      <li>After changes are accepted, the editor dialog calls the UI
      adapters and tells them to save their values to their respective
      objects (breakpoints, conditions, and monitors).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Conditions work</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Must be given Session instance to retrieve information in
      order to evaluate the condition.</li>

      <li>Returns true if the condition is satisfied.</li>

      <li>EditorDialog shows a list of defined Conditions.</li>

      <li>ConditionUI provides a String descriptor for the
      condition.</li>

      <li>EditorDialog provides &quot;add condition&quot; and
      &quot;remove condition&quot; buttons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How breakpoints are persisted</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The breakpoint groups, breakpoints, conditions, and monitors
      are all stored in nodes of type
      <code>java.util.prefs.Preferences</code>, the class provided in
      JDK 1.4 and later.</li>

      <li>Serialization begins with the default breakpoint and
      traverses down the tree until everything has been saved.</li>

      <li>Breakpoint manager handles [de]serialization of the
      breakpoints.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How breakpoints link up with source code</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Have a &quot;LocatableBreakpoint&quot; interface that certain
      breakpoint classes will implement.</li>

      <li>A resolved locatable breakpoint will have a Location for the
      breakpoint.</li>

      <li>A resolved locatable breakpoint can determine if it belongs
      to a certain source file or not (uses the locatable event
      request&#39;s location).</li>

      <li>An unresolved locatable breakpoint can make a guess as to
      whether it belongs to a certain source file or not (uses the
      class name pattern to match the filename).</li>

      <li>How will unresolved method breakpoints know which line they
      are set at?</li>

      <li>If classname of locatable breakpoint is not wild-carded, can
      use it to map to the source file.</li>
    </ul>
