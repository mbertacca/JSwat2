    <h2>Panels and Views</h2>

    <h3>Panels</h3>

    <p>Most of the display areas in JSwat are implemented as
    &quot;panels&quot;. The panels have an interface made up of JFC
    components, and they hold the model that contains data to be
    displayed. In the case of a debugger front-end like JSwat, the data
    is usually maintained by the debugger back-end. The JSwat panels
    interface with the JPDA to acquire the necessary data.</p>

    <p>Presently, panels will display the threads, classes, local
    variables, data members, error messages, and the like. Each panel
    is specialized for the type of information it will display. In most
    panels, either a JList, JTree, or JTable is used to display the
    debugging information. The panels are kept up-to-date via the
    <code>refresh()</code> method. This is invoked by the
    <code>Session</code>, via the <code>UIAdapter</code>, whenever an
    appropriate event has occurred.</p>

    <p>Panels may also listen for JPDA events on their own and update
    the panel as necessary.</p>

    <h3>Views</h3>

    <p>So far, the only type of data that is not displayed in a panel
    is a source code file. This is displayed in a &quot;view&quot;. In
    the case of a view, the data does not come from the debugger
    back-end. Instead, it may come from the local hard drive or another
    resource, such as a bytecode stream.</p>

    <p>Views may also listen for JPDA events on their own and update
    the view as necessary.</p>
