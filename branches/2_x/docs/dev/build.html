  <title>JSwat - How to Build JSwat</title>

  <h2>How to Build JSwat</h2>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>

  <p>You will need the the latest version of the <a href=
  "http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> tool. This Java tool makes
  building a JSwat distribution very easy. Download and install Ant
  before continuing.</p>

  <h3>Making the Build</h3>

  <p>Building a JSwat binary or source package with Ant is very
  straight-forward. First, download and install Ant, which is really
  quite easy. Next, invoke &#39;<kbd>ant dist</kbd>&#39; in a command
  shell from the directory containing the JSwat <code>build.xml</code>
  file. This will make the source and binary packages, which are packed
  in <code>.zip</code> files.</p>

  <h3>Testing the Build</h3>

  <p>Testing the build is pretty straightforward. Extract the files
  from the archive created during the build process described above,
  then start JSwat as described in the <code>README.html</code> file.
  The general idea is to make sure the JSwat jar file contains all the
  necessary classes and resource bundles. If any errors occur you may
  want to check that the <code>build.xml</code> includes all of the
  necessary files for JSwat to run properly.</p>

  <p>Some ideas for what to test:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Access the help files. Search the help for a keyword, like
    &quot;session&quot;.</li>

    <li>Access the command help. Search for a keyword using
    &#39;<code>apropos</code>&#39;.</li>

    <li>Set the language to French or Japanese to test the
    translation.</li>

    <li>Open a Java source file, ensuring that the Java parser is
    activated, to confirm that the Java parser library is
    included.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Releasing the Build</h3>

  <p>Both of the <code>.zip</code> files should now be uploaded to the
  SourceForge <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/projects/jswat/">project</a> site. If you do
  not know how this is done, see the <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> documentation. Be sure to
  notify the people watching the project so they know of the new
  release. Once this is done, visit the Freshmeat <a href=
  "http://freshmeat.net/projects/jswat/">project</a> page and add a new
  release there. And finally, send out an email to the <a href=
  "http://www.bluemarsh.com/java/jswat/mail-lists.html">jswat-announce</a>
  mailing list with the list of changes in this release.</p>
