  <h3>General Design Goals</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Flexibility</strong></dt>

    <dd>In general, JSwat will be designed with flexibility as one of
    the most important considerations. This program will grow and
    improve over some time to come, so decisions made now must not
    limit future opportunities.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Extensibility</strong></dt>

    <dd>JSwat is a very extensible program. New debugger commands can
    be written and added to the debugger without having to change the
    existing code. Additionally, new actions and interface adapters can
    also be easily written.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Loose-Coupling</strong></dt>

    <dd>The term &quot;loose-coupling&quot; refers to the manner in
    which the various parts of a system connect with one another.
    Classes that are tightly-coupled will refer to each other directly,
    by name. This generally leads to inflexible designs that are hard
    to extend to future needs. Loose-coupling is achieved by using
    design patterns like Observer, Bridge, Strategy, Mediator, and so
    on (see <span style="text-decoration: underline">Design Patterns -
    Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</span> by Gamma,
    Helm, Johnson, Vlissides).</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Output</h3>

  <p>Output from JSwat is generally displayed using the graphical
  interface, via dialogs, panels, or the messages text area. This is
  the normal means by which the program transmits messages to the user.
  Output to the console is forbidden for all but a handful of reasons,
  outlined below.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>User invokes the <code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code>
    command.</li>

    <li>Program is running in console mode.</li>

    <li>Messages are being directed to standard output via the
    &quot;Capture Messages&quot; action.</li>

    <li>An error occurred that could not be displayed by any other
    means. This is limited to the <code>Main</code> class, which has no
    elegant way of reporting errors, and the <code>Log</code> class,
    which sends output to the console when none of the registered
    output streams are functioning.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Logging</h3>

  <p>The use of the <code>java.util.logging.Logger</code> class to
  report errors or warnings is forbidden. Instead, use the
  <code>UIAdapter.showMessage()</code> method to report any problems.
  The interface adapter is reachable from a <code>Session</code>
  instance.</p>
