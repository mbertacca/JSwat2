  <title>JSwat - How to Write a UI Adapter</title>

  <h2>How to Write a UI Adapter</h2>

  <h3>Initialization</h3>

  <p>JSwat must be prepared in a very particular fashion, otherwise it
  is quite likely that something will go wrong later on. Fortunately,
  this is achieved in a very simple manner. Below is a code snippet to
  initailize JSwat and prepare it for use.</p>
  <pre>
Main.init();
Main.setUIAdapter(YourUIAdapter.class);
Session session = Main.newSession();
</pre>

  <p>The <code>Main</code> class referenced in the code snippet above
  is none other than <code>com.bluemarsh.jswat.Main</code>, which is
  used to start up and tear down JSwat.</p>

  <h4><code>initComplete()</code></h4>

  <p>When this method is called in your UI adapter, you should take the
  following actions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>If any JSwat <code>Panel</code>s are being displayed, they must
    have their <code>refreshLater()</code> methods called (the same as
    might be done in the <code>refreshDisplay()</code> method).</li>

    <li>If the <code>CommandManager</code> is to be used to interpret
    user input, you should invoke <code>runRCFiles()</code> in the
    <code>com.bluemarsh.jswat.ui.StartupRunner</code> class.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Terminating</h3>

  <p>As with initialization, terminating JSwat properly is rather
  important. Again, the code for properly closing JSwat is extremely
  simple.</p>
  <pre>
// Using the Session instance returned from Main.newSession()...
Main.endSession(session, false);
</pre>

  <p>If the second argument to <code>endSession()</code> is
  <code>true</code>, <code>Main</code> will invoke the
  <code>exit()</code> method on the UI adapter associated with the
  Session. The <code>exit()</code> method of your UI adapter can do
  whatever is sensible for the environment. Typically this means
  calling <code>System.exit()</code>. If, however, your UI adapter is a
  plugin to another application, it would probably do nothing when this
  method is invoked.</p>
