  <title>JSwat - How to Write JSwat Commands</title>

  <h2>How to Write JSwat Commands</h2>

  <h3>How to Write New Commands</h3>

  <p>Commands are the invokable objects in JSwat that perform some kind
  of operation. Some example commands are: attach, stop, step,
  disablegc, print, and threads. Below is a brief discussion of how to
  write new commands for JSwat, including what features are available
  to commands.</p>

  <p>All commands must subclass the <code>JSwatCommand</code> class,
  defined in the <code>com.bluemarsh.jswat.command</code> package.
  <code>JSwatCommand</code> provides some basic functionality needed
  for all JSwat commands. Each JSwat command class is named using the
  name of the command as the prefix, followed by the
  &quot;Command&quot; suffix. For example, the new
  &#39;<code>friday</code>&#39; command class must be named
  &quot;<code>fridayCommand</code>&quot; and placed in the
  <code>com.bluemarsh.jswat.command</code> package. When the user
  invokes &#39;friday&#39; at the JSwat command prompt, the
  <code>CommandManager</code> class will find the
  <code>fridayCommand</code> class, create an instance of it, and call
  its &quot;<code>perform</code>&quot; method.</p>

  <p>One instance of each command is created per instance of a JSwat
  session.</p>

  <p>JSwat commands can do just about anything any ordinary Java code
  can do. All of the work of a JSwat command is carried out in its
  <code>perform</code> method. This method is given several parameters
  which enable the command to perform its task. The first parameter is
  the Session object running the command. The <code>Session</code>
  provides access to most everything the command could ever want,
  including threads, context manager, event handler,
  <code>CommandManager</code>, etc. The second argument is a
  <code>CommandArguments</code> which provides the command arguments.
  For instance, if the <code>friday</code> command took two arguments,
  a thread ID and an object reference, those would be passed in the
  <code>args</code> parameter. It is up to the <code>friday</code>
  command to parse the strings and resolve the arguments. The third and
  final argument to the <code>perform</code> method is the
  <code>Log</code> instance to which the command may write messages.
  This is the same log as the one returned from
  <code>Session.getStatusLog()</code>.</p>

  <h4>Connecting the command</h4>

  <p>To make the new command available to users, edit the file
  <code>classes/com/bluemarsh/jswat/command/Bundle.properties</code> as
  described below.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Add command name to <code>commandList</code> property.</li>

    <li>Add a &quot;&lt;name&gt;Desc&quot; entry.</li>

    <li>Add a &quot;&lt;name&gt;Help&quot; entry.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Insert your new entries in alphabetical order so they are easy to
  locate.</p>

  <p>To connect the new command into the interactive help system, add
  entries to the <code>help.properties</code> file in the command
  package.</p>

  <h4>Testing the command</h4>

  <p>When the new command is ready for general use, write a unit test
  case for it. If the command requires an active session and/or
  arguments, add the test case to the appropriate test case suites. See
  the examples in the
  <code>test/junit/classes/com/bluemarsh/jswat/command</code>
  directory.</p>
