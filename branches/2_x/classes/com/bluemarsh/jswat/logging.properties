# "handlers" specifies a comma separated list of log Handler classes.
# These handlers will be installed during VM startup. Note that these
# classes must be on the system classpath. By default we only
# configure a ConsoleHandler, which will only show messages at the
# INFO and above levels.
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler


# Default global logging level.
# This specifies which kinds of events are logged across all loggers.
# For any given facility this global level can be overriden by a
# facility specific level Note that the ConsoleHandler also has a
# separate level setting to limit messages printed to the console.
