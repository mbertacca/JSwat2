    <h3>Capturing Messages</h3>

    <h4>Debugger Messages</h4>

    <p>Debugger messages are those messages seen in the JSwat
    &quot;Messages&quot; panel of the main window whenever a command or
    action is performed. Each time a breakpoint is hit or a single step
    is performed, a message is printed to the panel. This text area
    contains up to a defined maximum number of lines. This maximum is
    set in the program preferences, accessed by a menu item in the
    &quot;Options&quot; menu. A scroll bar on the side of the text area
    allows you to scroll up to see earlier messages. The text area also
    has a popup menu that allows copying selected text to the system
    clipboard.</p>

    <h4>Capturing Messages</h4>

    <p>JSwat provides a means for capturing the messages. Using the
    &quot;Capture Messages&quot; action found in the
    &quot;Options&quot; menu you can send the messages to JSwat&#39;s
    standard output stream (the console that started JSwat), to a named
    file, or both. In the dialog that appears after selecting
    &quot;Capture Messages&quot; you may check the &quot;Capture to
    stdout&quot; or &quot;Capture to file&quot; options. If you select
    the &quot;Capture to file&quot;, be sure to enter a filename in the
    text field at the bottom of the dialog.</p>

    <p>To turn off the message capturing, simply bring up the same
    &quot;Capture Messages&quot; dialog and uncheck the checked
    options. If you only wish to change the name of the file which is
    catching the messages, you may simply type a new name into the
    dialog and press okay. The previous file will be closed and the new
    file will be created. Make sure the &quot;Capture to file&quot;
    option is checked before you press Ok.</p>

    <p>Note that when capturing to file the messages do not flush to
    the file immediately. Turning off the file capture will cause the
    buffers to be flushed to disk. <em>(I would have preferred the
    contents be flushed immediately but it does not seem to
    work.)</em></p>
