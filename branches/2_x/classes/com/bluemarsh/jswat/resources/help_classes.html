    <h3>Classes</h3>

    <p>The loaded classes of the debuggee are displayed in the
    &quot;Classes&quot; panel. The classes are shown in the form of a
    tree, starting with the top-level package names (e.g.
    &quot;com&quot;, &quot;java&quot;, &quot;org&quot;).
    Double-clicking on a class will cause the tree node to be expanded
    to show the methods defined in that class. Double-clicking on one
    of those method nodes will open a source view for the class,
    scrolling to the location of the method. An error will occur if
    JSwat cannot find the source file. This is generally caused by a
    missing or incorrect sourcepath setting. See the section on <a
    href="help_paths.html">Classpath and Sourcepath</a> for more
    information. Additionally, the location of native methods and
    interface methods are not known, so the view will be opened but not
    scrolled.</p>

    <h4>Class Loader</h4>

    <p>The class tree display may include a number in parentheses
    behind some of the class names. This number indicates the unique
    object identifier of the class loader that loaded the class. This
    is helpful when writing custom class loaders. <em>Note: the number
    will be different each time the debuggee is started.</em></p>

    <p>Since there may be multiple class loaders, you may see the same
    class in the class tree multiple times. Each instance will have a
    different class loader ID number. With regards to setting
    breakpoints, or viewing the source code for the class, it does not
    matter which instance of the class you select. They are in fact the
    same class, just different instances of it.</p>

    <h3>Options</h3>

    <h4>Hide core classes</h4>

    <p>The Classes panel offers an option to hide the core Java
    classes. By default this is turned on. The panel has a popup menu
    to toggle this option. The core classes are those under the
    <code>com.sun</code>, <code>java</code>, <code>javax</code>, and
    <code>sun</code> packages. Also hidden are all array types.</p>

    <h4>Auto refresh contents</h4>

    <p>The Classes panel offers an option to automatically refresh the
    contents of the panel as classes are loaded and unloaded in the
    debuggee. By default this is turned on. Turning off the automatic
    refresh can significantly improve the startup time of the debuggee.
    When auto refresh is turned off, you can manually refresh the
    Classes panel by clicking on the &quot;Refresh Panels&quot; item in
    the &quot;View&quot; menu, or by clicking on the
    &quot;Refresh&quot; toolbar button.</p>
