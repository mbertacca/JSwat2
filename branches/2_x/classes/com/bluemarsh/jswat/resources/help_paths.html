  <h3>Classpath and Sourcepath</h3>

  <h4>Classpath</h4>

  <p>The classpath setting in JSwat is passed to the debuggee VM when
  it is launched. The way in which JSwat handles the classpath is quite
  simple. When JSwat is started, it checks if the classpath session
  property (see <a href="help_sessions.html">Sessions</a>) has been
  defined. If it is empty, then the value of the System property
  <code>java.class.path</code> is used as the classpath.</p>

  <p>When JSwat launches a debuggee VM, it sets the classpath of the
  debuggee VM to the classpath session property. When JSwat is
  connecting to a remote debuggee VM then the classpath in JSwat
  becomes the classpath of the remote VM. This is only temporary during
  the active remote session. Thus you will probably see a different
  classpath value depending on whether a remote debugging session is
  active or not.</p>

  <p>When using either the <code>load</code> command or the &quot;Start
  VM&quot; dialog, you may provide an alternate value for the
  classpath. You do this with the &quot;<code>-cp</code>&quot; Java VM
  option. This will overwrite the classpath session property.</p>

  <p>See the help for the <code>classpath</code> JSwat command to learn
  how to view and set the classpath used by JSwat. An easier way to
  modify the classpath is through the &quot;Set Classpath&quot; menu
  item in the &quot;Options&quot; menu.</p>

  <p><strong>Overriding the classpath at startup:</strong> If you wish
  to override the classpath session property when starting JSwat, you
  have only one option: invoke the <code>classpath</code> command.
  JSwat allows invoking an arbitrary command at startup, so simply
  invoke JSwat like so:</p>
  <pre>
% java com.bluemarsh.jswat.Main classpath &lt;CLASSPATH&gt;
 or
% java -jar jswat2.jar classpath &lt;CLASSPATH&gt;
</pre>

  <p>You may want to run another command as well, such as launching a
  debuggee VM. See the <a href="help_commands.html">commands help</a>
  for how to invoke multiple commands at one time.</p>

  <h4>Sourcepath</h4>

  <p>The sourcepath in JSwat looks just like a classpath setting. It is
  used for finding source files when the classpath does not refer to
  the locations of source files. The sourcepath is simply another means
  of finding the source file for a class. If a sourcepath is not set,
  JSwat will use the classpath to find the source files.</p>

  <p>The format of the sourcepath is the same as the classpath. That
  is, if your source code is in <code>/java/source/stuff</code> and
  your classes are in <code>/java/classes/stuff</code> and the name of
  your class is <code>stuff.Test</code>, then the sourcepath should be
  set to <code>/java/source</code>, just as the classpath is set to
  <code>/java/classes</code>. You may also add Zip or Jar files to your
  sourcepath, and JSwat will find the source files inside of the named
  archives. Just as with the directories, the paths of the files in the
  archives must match the fully-qualified names of the classes (e.g.
  &quot;<code>java/lang/String.java</code>&quot; for
  &quot;<code>java.lang.String</code>&quot;).</p>

  <p>The sourcepath can be set one of two ways in JSwat. First, it can
  be passed when launching JSwat using the <code>-D</code> argument to
  the JVM, like so:</p>
  <pre>
% java -Djava.source.path=/usr/java/src -jar jswat.jar
</pre>

  <p>This value will override any previous sourcepath setting in JSwat.
  This is unlike the classpath, which defaults to the setting in JSwat
  rather than the <code>java.class.path</code> property setting.</p>

  <p>The second way to set the sourcepath is with the
  <code>sourcepath</code> command. This works just like the
  <code>classpath</code> command and takes a set of directory paths and
  Zip/Jar files as an argument. On Windows the directory paths are
  separated with &#39;<code>;</code>&#39; characters, while on Unix
  systems it is the &#39;<code>:</code>&#39; character. An easier way
  to modify the sourcepath is through the &quot;Set Sourcepath&quot;
  menu item in the &quot;Options&quot; menu.</p>

  <h4>How JSwat Finds Source Files</h4>

  <p>JSwat uses the classpath and sourcepath to locate source files.
  Source files are those that end with the &quot;Default
  extension&quot;, set in the preferences dialog. This defaults to
  <code>.java</code>. An example is perhaps the easiest way to describe
  the process.</p>

  <p>Take for instance the class <code>java.lang.String</code>. Assume
  the source file is called <code>String.java</code> and is located in
  the directory <code>/usr/java/src/java/lang</code>. Additionally,
  assume that the classpath is set to
  <code>/usr/java/jre/lib/rt.jar</code>. In this case, JSwat is not
  able to find the source file for <code>java.lang.String</code> since
  it has not been given the location of the source code.</p>

  <p>This is why the sourcepath is useful. With the classpath set to
  <code>/usr/java/jre/lib/rt.jar</code>, JSwat only sees class files in
  that jar file. If we set the sourcepath to be
  <code>/usr/java/src</code> then JSwat will look for the file named
  <code>/usr/java/src/java/lang/String.java</code> -- the source file
  for the <code>java.lang.String</code> class.</p>

  <h5>Source Stratum</h5>

  <p>As with the default file extension, the source stratum helps JSwat
  find source files for each class. The default source stratum for
  JSwat is set to &quot;Java&quot; because that is the stratum for the
  Java programming language. Generally you do not want to change this.
  However, if you are going to change the default file extension, then
  you should also change the default stratum. The stratum value can be
  changed in the preferences dialog.</p>
