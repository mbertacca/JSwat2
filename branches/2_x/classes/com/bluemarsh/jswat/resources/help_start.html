    <h3>Starting the Debuggee</h3>

    <p>The very first thing you are likely to do with JSwat is start
    debugging your Java code. This is done through one of several
    means.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using the &quot;Start VM&quot; item in the &quot;VM&quot;
      menu, or the &quot;new document&quot; icon in the toolbar.</li>

      <li>Using the <code>load</code> command. See the command
      documentation using <code>help load</code> at the command
      prompt.</li>

      <li>Connecting to the remote debuggee. See the help on <a
      href="help_remote.html">remote debugging</a> for more
      information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The first option is typically the most popular since it involves
    the least amount of typing and offers the most visual cues for the
    required information. The rest of this help file will discuss this
    option exclusively.</p>

    <h4>The Fields</h4>

    <p>The input fields of the Start VM dialog are described as
    follows.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><em>Java Home</em></dt>

      <dd>This is the directory containing the Java runtime. Typically
      this is filled in with a default value and does not need to be
      adjusted. If at some point the location has changed, simply clear
      the field to have JSwat rediscover the new location automatically
      (after pressing OK to this dialog). If this fails for any reason,
      you will need to enter the path to the &quot;jre&quot; directory
      manually.</dd>

      <dt><em>JVM Executable</em></dt>

      <dd>This is the name of the <code>java</code> executable. The
      default should be acceptable in nearly all cases, but should your
      case differ, you can change the name to whatever is appropriate
      for the Java runtime being used.</dd>

      <dt><em>Debuggee VM Options</em></dt>

      <dd>These are options to the debuggee JVM, such as
      <code>-X<em>xxx</em></code>, <code>-hotspot</code>,
      <code>-cp</code>, <code>-jar</code>, and <code>-D</code>. When
      using the <code>-jar</code> option, you may put the name of the
      jar file in this field or the Class name field described below.
      However, the next time the Start VM dialog appears, the jar file
      name will be in the Class name field.</dd>

      <dt><em>Set -D Properties</em></dt>

      <dd>This button presents a dialog for conveniently setting the
      system properties for the debuggee VM. These are the properties
      defined using the <code>-D<em>name</em>=<em>value</em></code>
      option. Initially the dialog is populated with any
      <code>-D</code> properties found in the VM Options field
      described above. The properties set in this dialog will then
      appear in the VM Options field after clicking OK in the
      properties dialog.</dd>

      <dt><em>Class name and arguments</em></dt>

      <dd>Like the label says, this is the name of the class to be
      debugged, along with any arguments expected by that class. If the
      <code>-jar</code> option is used, this field holds the name of
      the jar file rather than the name of the class. The jar file must
      have the <strong>Main-Class</strong> property set in the manifest
      for the <code>-jar</code> option to work.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Canonicalized Options</h4>

    <p>You may recall the option in the &quot;Options&quot; menu for
    enabling the Classic VM support in the debuggee. With this feature
    enabled, the <code>-classic</code> option will automatically be
    used in launching the debuggee. However, the option will
    <em>not</em> appear in the Start VM dialog&#39;s VM Options field.
    The same is true for the classpath definition. You can define the
    classpath using the <code>classpath</code> command or the &quot;Set
    Classpath&quot; dialog, accessible from the &quot;Options&quot;
    menu, and that will be passed to the debuggee automatically.</p>

    <p>Both of these options are automatically added to the set of JVM
    options given in the Start VM dialog during the launching process,
    but only under certain conditions. For the Classic VM option, if
    <code>-client</code>, <code>-hotspot</code>, <code>-server</code>,
    or <code>-classic</code> option appears in the JVM options field,
    then the Classic VM feature is silently ignored.</p>

    <p>Similarly, if the JVM Options field contains the
    <code>-cp</code> or <code>-classpath</code> option, the classpath
    defined via the <code>classpath</code> command or the &quot;Set
    Classpath&quot; dialog is ignored. Instead, the argument to the
    <code>-cp</code> or <code>-classpath</code> option is used.</p>

    <h4>Now What?</h4>

    <p>After filling in the fields in the Start VM dialog, press the OK
    button and wait a few seconds. You should soon see the debuggee JVM
    start up and invoke the <code>main</code> method of the class named
    in the dialog. Assuming your program does not exit immediately, you
    are ready to begin debugging.</p>

    the General Topics section.</p>
