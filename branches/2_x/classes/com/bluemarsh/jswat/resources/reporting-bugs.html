    <h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>

    <p>Before reporting a new bug, it would be very helpful to ensure
    that the bug has not already been found.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Ensure that you are using the latest version of JSwat. If
      not, you must try to reproduce the problem using the latest
      version. The bug may have been found and fixed already.</li>

      <li>Read the pertinent JSwat documentation and help information.
      There is not all that much and it will be worth your time.</li>

      <li>Check the <code>BUGS.txt</code> file distributed with JSwat.
      This lists the known bugs in the JDK and JRE.</li>

      <li>Search the bug database on the web site. This is a lot easier
      than it may seem at first.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If it still seems like you have found a new bug, please send as
    much of the following information as you can to the
    <strong>jswat-bugs</strong> mailing list.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Operating System (e.g. Windows XP, RedHat Linux 7.3)</li>

      <li>JDK version (e.g. 1.4.0)</li>

      <li>JDK brand (e.g. JavaSoft)</li>

      <li>JSwat version (must be the latest)</li>

      <li>Classpath and sourcepath being used, if relevant.</li>

      <li>What you were doing that produced the bug.</li>

      <li>Any pertinent error messages.</li>
    </ul>
