  <h3>Source View</h3>

  <p>The source view displays Java source code in a scrollable text
  area. The source views are opened automatically when a breakpoint is
  hit and while single-stepping through code, such that the current
  point of execution is displayed. Source views can be opened manually
  using the &quot;Open File&quot; menu item in the &quot;File&quot;
  menu, which presents a file open dialog for locating and selecting a
  source file to display. Additionally, the classes panel may be used
  to view source for a particular class. Simply double-click on the
  desired method under the name of the class you want to view.</p>

  <h4>Parser Errors</h4>

  <p>If the source view attempted to parse the source code as Java
  language code and encountered an error, the error line is highlighted
  in red. Moving the mouse pointer over the line should show a tooltip
  that contains the parser error message. The message may be preceded
  by a pair of numbers. The first value is the line number and the
  second is the column number (both one-based) where the error was
  found.</p>

  <h4><a id="gutter" name="gutter"></a>The Gutter</h4>

  <p>The gutter is the place where the line numbers are shown, on the
  left side of the source view. The background color is used to
  indicate the location of breakpoints. The default light gray
  indicates that line does not have a breakpoint. The other colors are
  defined as follows:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Red</strong></dt>

    <dd>Expired; hit count reached &#39;expire count&#39;.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Gray</strong></dt>

    <dd>Disabled by user.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Blue</strong></dt>

    <dd>Unresolved; waiting for class to load.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Yellow</strong></dt>

    <dd>Skipping hits until &#39;skip count&#39; is reached.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Green</strong></dt>

    <dd>Ready to be hit.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>In addition to indicating breakpoint status, the gutter may be
  used to set breakpoints. By clicking the mouse in the gutter during
  an active session (<a href="help_sessions.html">Sessions</a>), you
  can create a breakpoint where one does not exist, disable it if one
  does exist, or remove it if it is already disabled. That is to say,
  clicking on the same line three times will: create the breakpoint,
  disable the breakpoint, and finally remove the breakpoint.</p>

  <h4>Current Location</h4>

  <p>The current location is like the current thread (see
  <a href="help_threads.html">Threads, Call Stack</a>). It is set
  whenever a breakpoint is hit and indicates the line about to be
  executed in the debuggee. The line is indicated in the source view
  using a blue highlight across that line. Changing the current thread
  or stack frame will move the highlight to the corresponding line of
  the appropriate source view.</p>

  <h4>Refreshing</h4>

  <p>The source views are automatically refreshed whenever a debugging
  session is started (either by attaching to a remote debuggee or
  launching a debuggee). Additionally, the views may be manually
  refreshed using the &quot;Refresh&quot; button in the toolbar, or the
  &quot;Refresh Display&quot; menu item in the &quot;View&quot;
  menu.</p>

  <h4>Searching</h4>

  <p>You can search for words and phrases in the source view by using
  the &quot;Search Source&quot; menu item in the &quot;View&quot; menu
  (or the toolbar button with the binoculars). In the Find dialog,
  simply enter the word or phrase you are looking for, then click Ok.
  To ignore letter casing, select the checkbox provided. The search
  phrase is actually a regular expression, although any simple word or
  phrase will work. See the JDK documentation for the
  <code>java.util.regex.Pattern</code> class to learn about the
  supported features.</p>

  <h4>Options</h4>

  <p>There are a number of options affecting the view, which include
  the following. They are specified in the &quot;Options&quot; submenu
  of the &quot;Options&quot; menu.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Colorize</strong></dt>

    <dd>This enables or disables the use of a Java lexical analyzer to
    determine the locations of all of the tokens in the source file.
    This information, when enabled, is used to colorize the source
    code. You may want to disable this if you usually view files that
    are not Java source code.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Parse as Java</strong></dt>

    <dd>This enables or disables the use of a Java language parser to
    determine the locations of all of the classes and methods in the
    source file. This information, when enabled, is used to set
    breakpoints and scroll to method definitions. You may want to
    disable this if you usually view files that are not Java source
    code.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Maximize</strong></dt>

    <dd>When enabled, the source view windows will be maximized when
    they are first opened.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h4>Launching External Editor</h4>

  <p>The source view popup menu contains an item labeled &quot;Open in
  editor&quot;. When this item is selected, the program specified in
  the &quot;External source editor&quot; field of the &quot;Source
  View&quot; user preferences category is launched. The &quot;%f&quot;
  in the command string is replaced with the full path of the source
  file. The &quot;%l&quot; is replaced with the line number on which
  the source view popup was invoked.</p>

  <p>The external editor is executed via the
  <code>Runtime.exec()</code> method. If the Java VM cannot find the
  editor as specified, you must either set your program path
  appropriately, or specify the full path to the editor executable.</p>
