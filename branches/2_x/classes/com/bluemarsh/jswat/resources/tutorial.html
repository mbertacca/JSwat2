  <h3>Tutorial</h3>

  <h4>Tutorial Program</h4>

  <p>In order to get started with the tutorial, you will need to create
  a sample program to debug. One has already been written, it simply
  needs to be saved to a file. Follow this
  <a href="tutorial.java">link</a> to the example code, select the
  program text and press the &quot;Copy&quot; button in the help viewer
  toolbar; then paste the text into a text editor and save it to a file
  named <code>tutorial.java</code>. We will be using this example to
  learn more about JSwat&#39;s features and how to use them.</p>

  <p>Compile the file you just created using <kbd>javac -g</kbd>, which
  will compile the class with local variable and line number
  information. This information is needed when you plan on debugging
  your code. Without it, the debugger cannot debug the class.</p>

  <h4>Setting the Classpath</h4>

  <p>Assuming you are an experienced Java developer, you know what the
  classpath is and how it is used, so that will not be covered here.
  For an explanation on how JSwat uses the classpath setting, see the
  &quot;Classpath&quot; related help page, accessible from the built-in
  help.</p>

  <p>Start JSwat and select the &quot;Set Classpath&quot; item from the
  &quot;Options&quot; menu. In the dialog that appears, clear out all
  of the entries already found there, as chances are they have more to
  do with running JSwat than debugging the tutorial sample. Do this
  with the &quot;Remove Path&quot; button at the bottom of the dialog.
  Once all of the classpath entries are removed, enter a new path entry
  by pressing the &quot;Add Path&quot; button. Use the file selector
  dialog that appears to select the directory containing the
  <code>tutorial.class</code> file. Once that is done, accept the new
  classpath setting by selecting the &quot;OK&quot; button.</p>

  <h4>Setting the Sourcepath</h4>

  <p>If you placed the <code>tutorial.java</code> and
  <code>tutorial.class</code> files in different directories, you will
  need to set the JSwat sourcepath setting. The sourcepath is similar
  to the classpath except that it tells JSwat where to find source code
  rather than class files. The sourcepath is set in the same manner as
  the classpath, except that it is done by selecting &quot;Set
  Sourcepath&quot; from the &quot;Options&quot; menu. The purpose is to
  select the directory where the <code>tutorial.java</code> file is
  located, which allows JSwat to find it when all that is known is the
  name of the class.</p>

  <h4>Loading the Class</h4>

  <p>Now that the classpath is set, start the debugging session by
  selecting &quot;Start VM&quot; from the &quot;VM&quot; menu. A dialog
  will appear asking you for the name of the class to be debugged,
  along with some other information that has already been filled in for
  you. Enter &quot;tutorial&quot; in the &quot;Class name&quot; field.
  Make sure the &quot;suspended&quot; checkbox is checked so the
  session will not resume until you tell it to. Now press the Ok button
  and you should see a message that looks something like this:</p>
  <pre>
VM loading with following options, class name, and class arguments.
/jdk/bin/java -cp /java/samples
tutorial
VM loaded
</pre>

  <p>This indicates that the debuggee VM was successfully created. At
  this point the debuggee VM has not attempted to locate the class in
  question. That is, you could use the start dialog to load the
  &quot;<code>noclass</code>&quot; class and the debuggee VM will load
  without an error. Only when you click on the &quot;Play&quot; button
  in the toolbar does the debuggee VM start and try to locate the main
  class. In fact, do this now to start the tutorial debuggee VM.</p>

  <p>The tutorial class will start and create a window with a single
  button. Now the tutorial program is waiting for you to do something.
  This gives us an opportunity to take a closer look at the JSwat
  window.</p>

  <h4>JSwat Window</h4>

  <p>Now that JSwat and the tutorial sample are running, you should
  notice that the JSwat window is made up of various panels that
  display information related to the debuggee. There is a panel called
  &quot;Threads&quot; which shows the threads in the debuggee VM. A
  panel showing the messages from JSwat is also visible, with a command
  input field below that. To the right is where source files are
  shown.</p>

  <p>You will notice that above the threads panel are a set of labeled
  tabs. When pressed these tabs bring other panels forward. They
  include a panel called &quot;Classes&quot; which shows the currently
  loaded classes in a hierarchal tree; &quot;Locals&quot; displays the
  local variables while single-stepping through code; and
  &quot;Watches&quot; which allows viewing field and local variables
  during program execution.</p>

  <p>If you have looked at the <code>tutorial.java</code> file you will
  notice that the first line of the <code>main()</code> method prints a
  message to the <code>System.out</code> output stream. The output from
  the debuggee VM is captured by JSwat into one of its panels. Click on
  the &quot;Output&quot; tab above the messages panel and you will see
  the message from the tutorial class. The &quot;Input:&quot; field
  below the output display is for entering text input to the debuggee
  VM on its <code>System.in</code> input stream.</p>

  <h4>Setting Breakpoints</h4>

  <p>We are now ready to try setting breakpoints with JSwat. We can do
  this through the source code viewer. The <code>tutorial.java</code>
  file should be visible already on the right side of the JSwat window.
  If it is not, go to the &quot;Classes&quot; panel and expand the
  &quot;tutorial&quot; node; double-click on the
  &quot;main(String[])&quot; node and the <code>tutorial.java</code>
  source file should open.</p>

  <p>With the tutorial source view open, click in the source view
  gutter area at line 12 of the source code. The gutter area is the
  part of the source view that shows the line numbers and has a gray
  background. The line number will now have a green background color.
  This indicates that a breakpoint is set at that line.</p>

  <p>Now switch to the tutorial program&#39;s window and click on the
  &quot;Push me&quot; button. Immediately JSwat signals that the
  debuggee VM has hit a breakpoint by raising its window above all
  others. The line of code that is about to be executed will be
  highlighted in blue in the source view. Additionally, JSwat will show
  the current location in the messages panel; the name of the thread is
  in square brackets, followed by the name of the class and method,
  which is in turn followed by the name of the source file and the line
  number where execution has stopped.</p>

  <p>By the way, when a breakpoint is hit at a certain line number (in
  this example, line 12), the debuggee VM has not yet executed that
  line of code. In this example, the <code>pushCount</code> field
  variable has not yet been incremented.</p>

  <h4>Single-Stepping</h4>

  <p>Now you are ready to learn about single stepping through the
  source code. Stepping one line of code at a time can be done by
  pressing the shortcut key for the &quot;Next Line&quot; menu item
  under the &quot;Step&quot; menu. The default shortcut key for this is
  the <kbd>F12</kbd> function key.</p>

  <p>Before you start single-stepping, click on the &quot;Locals&quot;
  tab above the class tree panel. This will bring the local variables
  panel forward and show the currently visible local variables. At line
  12 of the tutorial class, only &quot;e&quot; (method argument), and
  &quot;this&quot; (reference to the current object) are visible.
  Expand the &quot;this&quot; node to see the &quot;pushCount&quot;
  field.</p>

  <p>Press the <kbd>F12</kbd> key several times now and observe how the
  source line highlighter moves along through the source view. As you
  step through the code, you will also notice that the local variables
  panel is updated to show the latest visible variables and their
  values.</p>

  <p>To resume execution of the debuggee VM, press the &quot;Play&quot;
  button on the toolbar. The tutorial window will now have changed the
  button label to say &quot;Pushed 1 times&quot;.</p>

  <h4>Restarting the Session</h4>

  <p>Say that we want to reload the tutorial class after we have made a
  change to the source code and recompiled. An easy way to do this is
  to press the &quot;<code>New</code>&quot; button on the toolbar. This
  brings up the &quot;Start VM&quot; dialog that you saw at the
  beginning of the tutorial. Notice that the dialog contains the values
  you entered earlier. That is because JSwat remembers the values from
  the last time we started the debuggee VM.</p>

  <p>When you click the Ok button in the Start VM dialog, it will
  terminate the current debugging session and start a new one.</p>

  <h4>Exiting the Session</h4>

  <p>Exiting JSwat is easy -- just press on the window close button.
  JSwat will close the debuggee VM and then exit.</p>

  <p>If you exit JSwat while debugging a remote debuggee, JSwat will
  merely detach from the remote VM without terminating it.</p>
