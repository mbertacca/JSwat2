 * contains the resources defined in the Bundle.properties file within
 * this package. Only the classes in this package will use this
 * particular class. Identical Bundle classes will exist in all of the
 * packages in which resources are needed. Granted, this implies that
 * the class is reproduced verbatim from one package to the next, but it
 * is very fast and efficient.
